economic forum annual meeting in davos‐ klosters  in a world still consumed with navigating the aftershocks of the global financial crisis. but in the wings a new challenge for the financial system was growing in the form of fintech – new entrants that promised to rapidly reshape how financial products were structured provisioned and consumed. nearly four years later as this initiative draws to a close we take the opportunity to reflect on the changes to the financial system – taking stock of the impacts that fintechs have had and considering their evolving relationships with both incumbents and regulators. more importantly it presents an opportunity to consider what lies beyond the horizon for financial services. the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution have triggered a seismic shift in the financial system the implications of which will extend far beyond the fintechs that pioneered their use in financial services. value chains that have characterized the industry for decades are being disrupted and reshaped with implications for customers regulators incumbents and every other stakeholder in the financial system. in this fourth report of the future of financial services series we hope to build upon our previous work and provide the many stakeholders of the financial system with a better understanding of the forces transforming financial services as well as an outlook for its future. r. jesse mcwaters project lead disruptive innovation in financial services world economic forum rob galaski americas financial services leader deloitte contents 1. context

section context and approach world economic forum context and approach past reports this report represents the culmination of three phases of research into the transformative role of fintechs on the financial services ecosystem since december the world economic forum has strived to understand the impact of innovations on the financial services ecosystem and to determine how all stakeholders would be affected phase phase laid out a foundation for understanding the transformative potential of new entrants and innovations on business models in financial services. it focused on:  establishing a clear taxonomy for understanding which fintech innovations are the most relevant  mapping possible futures for the evolutionary paths of emerging fintech innovations  exploring the implications of fintech on key stakeholders (consumers  incumbents regulators  etc.) phase 1 outcomes are captured in the report the future of financial services phase phase 2 aimed to illustrate the role of financial infrastructure in enabling the future of financial services. it focused on:  understanding the transformative power of blockchain on shaping the future capabilities and characteristics of financial infrastructure  defining a high‐level blueprint for fully digital identity protocols that simultaneously empowers users  and simplifies and de‐risks identity transactions phase 2 culminated in the release of two reports  the future of financial infrastructure and a blueprint for digital identity what is a fintech? in this document we define a fintech to be a small technology‐enabled new entrant to financial services. this definition does not include large technology firms that enter financial services (e.g. apple with apple pay) or incumbent financial institutions who increase their focus on technology context approach key findings key uncertainties context and approach current report context the final phase returns to the structure of the report conducting a broad exploration of the forces reshaping the financial services ecosystem this report builds on the work of the previous reports exploring the forces reshaping the structure of the financial system. it also considers evolutionary paths for the future of the system as well as their implications for stakeholders report questions what are the innovations that have made the most impact on the financial ecosystem since the report and what are the ideas that have failed to produce impact? how will these innovations impact the ways in which financial services are structured provisioned and consumed in the future? what will be the implications of these innovations on the broader financial system? b2b partnerships emerging ecosystems context approach key findings key uncertainties context and approach project context over the last months the project team engaged with over experts and held workshops in order to answer pivotal questions industry leaders innovators  gained oversight guidance and thought leadership from c‐suite executives operating unit leaders of global financial institutions  and industry regulators  held in‐person and phone interviews with over innovative new entrants and subject matter experts  facilitated multistakeholder workshops at six global financial hubs with over total participants including industry leaders innovators subject matter experts  and regulators global workshops davos‐klosters switzerland january london uk february new york usa march april san francisco usa march shenzhen china april toronto canada may world economic forum context approach key findings key uncertainties section key findings and uncertainties world economic forum key findings overview fintechs have changed how financial services are structured provisioned and consumed but have not successfully established themselves as dominant players many fintechs (small technology‐enabled new entrants) came into existence with the goal of overtaking incumbents as the new dominant players in financial services – but have shifted to building partnerships as they struggle with scale and customer adoption where fintechs have succeeded where fintechs have fallen short fintechs have seized the initiative – defining the direction shape and pace of innovation across almost every subsector of financial services – and have succeeded as both stand‐alone businesses and crucial parts of financial value chains fintechs have reshaped customer expectations setting new and higher bars for user experience. through innovations like rapid loan adjudication fintechs have shown that the customer experience bar set by large technology firms such as apple and google can be met in financial services conclusion customer willingness to switch away from incumbents has been overestimated. customer switching costs are high and new innovations are often not sufficiently material to warrant the shift to a new provider especially as incumbents adapt* fintechs have struggled to create new infrastructure and establish new financial services ecosystems such as alternative payment rails or alternative capital markets. they have been much more successful in making improvements within traditional ecosystems and infrastructure fintechs have materially changed the basis of competition in financial services but have not yet materially changed the competitive landscape *caveat: in geographies where incumbent service providers did not exist and in segments where incumbents where not meeting customer segments’ needs new entrants to financial services have been able to build significant scale context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings overview although fintechs have failed to disrupt the competitive landscape they have laid the foundation for future disruption the success of fintechs in changing the basis of competition as well as the increasing pace of technology means that while financial institutions have the potential to improve rapidly they face rapid disruption both now and in the future some financial institutions have turned the threat of fintechs into an opportunity… the rapid growth of the fintech ecosystem allows firms to externalize parts of their innovation function as they wait and see which new offerings gain traction before deploying their the proliferation of fintechs provides financial institutions with a “supermarket” for capabilities allowing them to use acquisitions and partnerships to rapidly deploy new offerings own solutions …but the accelerating rate of change represents a serious threat the accelerating tempo of the innovation cycle in financial services means that a financial institution's success is predicated on business model agility and the ability to rapidly deploy partnerships neither of which are traditional core competencies of these institutions context approach key findings key uncertainties the ability to shop the fintech landscape for capabilities is not limited to incumbent institutions; today new entrants face significantly lower technological barriers to entering financial services  with potential long‐term implications for the competitive landscape key findings overview the project team has identified eight forces that have the potential to shift the competitive landscape of the financial ecosystem disruptive forces cost commoditization: financial institutions will accelerate the commoditization of their cost bases removing them as points of competition and creating new grounds for differentiation profit redistribution: technology and new partnerships will enable organizations to bypass traditional value chains thereby redistributing profit pools experience ownership: power will transfer to the owner of the customer interface; pure manufacturers must therefore become hyper‐scaled or hyper‐focused platforms rising: platforms that offer the ability to engage with different financial institutions from a single channel will become the dominant model for the delivery of financial services data monetization: data will become increasingly important for differentiation but static data sets will be enriched by flows of data from multiple sources combined and used in real time bionic workforce: as the ability of machines to replicate the behaviours of humans continues to evolve financial institutions will need to manage labour and capital as a single set of capabilities systemically important techs: financial institutions increasingly resemble and are dependent on large tech firms to acquire critical infrastructure and differentiating technologies financial regionalization: diverging regulatory priorities and customer needs will lead financial services in different regions of the world down distinct paths context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings cost commoditization financial institutions will accelerate the commoditization of their cost bases removing them as points of competition and creating new grounds for differentiation facing enormous pressure to reduce their cost base incumbent financial institutions are embracing new technologies as well as working with long‐time competitors and new entrants alike to commoditize cost drivers that do not provide competitive differentiation archetypes mutualization externalization automation incumbents are exploring the creation of new utilities and the expansion of existing utilities’ roles in order to standardize processes and avoid duplicating work between companies the range of activities that financial institutions are comfortable with externalizing has expanded significantly creating opportunities for both fintechs and incumbents to serve these needs seeking to preserve margins incumbents are turning to process automation tools to streamline processes and lower internal costs of activities such as error handling example: the monetary authority of singapore is working with several banks to build a national know your customer (kyc) utility which will reduce duplication and lower costs for all financial institutions context approach key findings example: blackrock’s aladdin platform provides risk analysis portfolio construction and compliance tools for institutional investors and retail wealth managers. the platform provides technology and support for industry‐standard processes key uncertainties example: automation anywhere is working with a wide range of banks to automate processes such as loan origination audit compliance and account reconciliation key findings cost commoditization sharing costs among peers and utilizing industry‐standard automation tools will de‐verticalize the value chain implications for fintechs  the rise of cost‐sharing utilities and b2b providers lowers the barriers to entry for new entrants implications for all financial institutions  organizations must view partnerships and ecosystem management as a company‐wide strategic focus  organizations will have to start thinking of security and permissions as a jigsaw – each “piece” will have to be treated separately to minimize the threat from any new external connection  organizations will need to improve tracking of data flows to protect users as information is shared with external companies implications for regulators  regulators need to monitor the growth of utilities and business‐to‐business (b2b) service providers and consider their potential systemic risks fintechs regulators incumbents implications for incumbents  incumbents will need to differentiate their customer‐facing processes as middle and back offices become commoditized context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings profit redistribution technology and new partnerships will enable organizations to bypass traditional value chains thereby redistributing profit pools the location of profit pools within and between value chains will shift as technological catalysts enable companies to change their positions and relationships archetypes intra‐value chain disruption inter‐value chain shifts technological value bridge existing value chain participants are bypassing traditional intermediaries and seeking partnerships directly with customer‐facing start‐ups thereby becoming direct competitors with past partners technology is allowing consumers to easily switch between products in different value chains migrating profit pools to new organizations new technologies can simplify connections within large and complicated networks making companies that focused on connecting participants more vulnerable to disruption example: munich re a large reinsurer is partnering with product start‐ups – including bought by many and trōv – to directly compete with their traditional insurance partners example: investment firms such as vanguard and betterment have started proposing exchange‐traded funds (etfs) as an alternative to savings accounts shifting customers from bank deposits example: stripe offers online merchants an easy and cost‐effective way to process payments online which was previously only accessible to large merchants with merchant bank accounts context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings profit redistribution as profit pools shift due to value chain movements intermediaries will face competitive pressure from all sides archetypes (continued) regulatory disruption regulators are curtailing financial institutions’ control over access to infrastructure lowering market power and shifting profits away from firms that oversee infrastructure example: the european union's revised payment services directive (psd2) threatens to disintermediate payment networks by mandating that banks allow open secure connections between merchants and user accounts implications for fintechs implications for regulators  the pool of potential partners that can provide scale capital and customer reach will expand beyond traditional adjacencies  regulators must monitor the shift in profit pools in order to identify the new value chain as long‐regulated companies become less relevant and new companies grow in importance fintechs regulators incumbents implications for all financial institutions  technology will reduce the cost of bypassing value chain intermediaries and reaching the end customer  companies will need to monitor their adjacencies for potential pressures/shifts from partners implications for incumbents  intermediaries that derive value from their position on the value chain will struggle to be profitable – scale will be necessary for survival context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings | experience ownership power will transfer to the owner of the customer experience; pure manufacturers must therefore become hyper‐scaled or hyper‐focused the rise of platforms means incumbents can no longer rely on controlling both product manufacturing and distribution allowing product distributors to leverage control of their customer experience and place pressure on manufacturers archetypes brand opportunity product curation control of data distributors’ ownership of the customer relationship places them in a position to grow their brand while de‐emphasizing that of the manufacturer particularly in cases where products are commoditized distributors control which products are distributed and how customers view products and can even steer customers towards certain products via recommendations the distributor’s location in a value chain allows it to collect data that is both deep (across the entire value chain) and broad (data on all product manufacturers) example: customers of robo‐advisors such as wealthfront purchase etfs from a wide range of companies but likely have limited awareness of the assets in their portfolio example: the apple app store allows almost all apps that pass a set of rules but stringently controls the front page – crucial for visibility  with over apps launched per day example: mastercard offers retailers advisory services with benchmarks and recommendations drawn from its visibility into data collected from comparable retailers context approach key findings key

retail distribution of financial products will take place within digital platforms either open or curated where customers will have the ability to choose between multiple providers pre‐existing platforms that cater to specific business needs and audiences will add financial products in effect becoming distribution channels for financial services platforms that aggregate customer data from different financial institutions will increase in number and scope reaching all sectors and allowing customers greater control over their data example: tencent’s webank platform acts as a storefront allowing retail customers to purchase products from multiple competing vendors of credit and asset management services example: wave’s accounting invoicing and reporting platform for small businesses

advanced analytics and target customers who change their behaviour (and needs) over time example: visa mobile location confirmation which is optional and offered through participating financial institutions’ mobile banking apps uses mobile geo‐location information as an addition to visa’s predictive fraud analytics in order to expand their customer data sets to collect new streams of data institutions are designing their digital experience to offer more customer value thus engaging customers more frequently partnerships with other companies solely for the purpose of data collection will increase allowing banks (and nonbanks) to collect complementary data they otherwise would not have access to example: facebook continually improves and adds features to its mobile app to increase

the sharing of data to ensure that the risk of hacking is as low as possible  regulators must also be aware of how banks use the additional data they collect and whether customers understand the impact of sharing their information  regulators must decide how much consumers can control their own information that they have shared with institutions implications for incumbents  incumbents will

development of platform ecosystems in many verticals with incumbents under growing pressure a mobile‐based connectivity ecosystem the absence of major consumer‐focused bank offerings and a largely innovation‐ friendly regulator all lead to large techs capturing significant market share unclear regulatory direction as well as the presence of a mature financial ecosystem and well‐served customers means that changes to the current ecosystem will likely be incremental example: the european markets in financial services directive is designed to introduce more transparency to capital markets; trade execution firms must show clear evidence of \"best execution\" example: in the absence of a mature payments system the alipay mobile payment app now owns over 50% of the $5.5 trillion chinese

(interchange fee regulation):  interchange fees are capped at 0.2‐0.3% of transaction value for debit and credit respectively  the “honour all cards” rule (forbidding merchants from selective card acceptance) no longer applies; instead cards are now sorted by category and retailers can choose which category of cards to accept payment initiation services allow merchants to link directly to the customer’s bank account bypassing a series of traditional intermediaries to lower costs account information services will allow services that are dependent on customer info such as account aggregation

value customers are reluctant to try a new method of payment (mobile) without a clear demonstrated improvement. ingrained behaviours mean that the less significant of an improvement a new solution represents the less patience customers will have with it lack of ecosystem support the ubiquity of card‐based technologies has meant that many vendors simply do not support mobile payments and it is often difficult to identify vendors that do. this creates a negative loop around the technology – the less support the less customers will want to adopt which leads to less support lack of single

intermediaries have the opportunity to gain market share as banks withdraw from payment‐related activities in favour of partnerships implications for card issuers  regulations and the appearance of alternatives mean that revenues associated with the issuing of cards will decline  an opportunity to gain market share arises as some card issuers will stop issuing cards  data increases in importance as a profit driver introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments | end state two post‐psd2 the world of online and retail payments could diverge significantly creating two distinct ecosystems banks are required to develop open apis that allow trusted third parties to easily and securely access customer accounts merchants (large online ones in particular) expand their current online systems to easily tap into those apis moving traffic away from traditional cards large techs design their systems (e.g. apple pay amazon one‐click) with direct bank connections built‐in and offer these to other online retailers to capture payments data customers fundamentally move away from card‐ based online payment schemes whereas point‐of‐ sale behaviours are slower to adapt creating two distinct ecosystems critical conditions early signs  “hard” psd2 or other regulations exist that force banks to develop simple secure and effective apis open to third parties  large tech solutions are developed that easily tie into these apis and allow for some information sharing  banks comply with psd2 in europe on time to eu specifications  parties from any two of three groups (merchants banks and large techs) form partnerships to develop solutions that allow easy consumer adoption  the continued absence of a comprehensive digital identity scheme prevents the online ecosystem from easily integrating with retail payments  post‐psd2 credit card usage holds steady in retail stores introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments | end state two the implications for customers are unclear but merchants benefit greatly on the back of shrinking profits for intermediaries implications for customers  direct connections with banks for online purchases mean less justification for credit card fees  adoption of online solutions may mean customers are more deeply entrenched in large tech ecosystems implications for merchants  less fees are paid to card issuers and intermediaries as more customers use direct solutions  the opportunity exists to choose partnerships with issuers/intermediaries if benefits align two ecosystems post‐psd2 implications for intermediaries  volumes and margins decline as some retailers and banks bypass traditional intermediaries  consolidation is therefore likely as players fight for a larger share of a smaller pool of profit  lack of online business forces a shift of focus to retail shopping to retain profits implications for card issuers  use of revolvers may decline somewhat as customers charge less to the card  issuers may ally with partners to push the use of their credit cards driving up usage introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments | end state three instead of convergence in payments the field of payments may fragment as merchants intermediaries and schemes all seek to differentiate even more fintech and other non‐bank payment solutions start appearing in the marketplace further fragmenting the payment experience for customers as all solutions are based around credit card usage customers find it relatively easy to juggle multiple different payment apps and tools and are rewarded with incentives market incumbents and credit card issuers continue to take their share of revenues but have difficulty piecing together a customer’s spending patterns as a result data aggregation and monetization schemes mostly fail to get off the ground presenting banks with a quandary regarding payments revenue critical conditions early signs  retailers both in‐store and online continue to develop customized payment solutions and invest in reward/loyalty schemes to get customers to use those solutions  banks fail to bridge the sku‐level data gap  the number of retail apps on a typical customer’s smartphone continues to increase  credit card usage online does not decline  no predominant payment channel appears out of the competitive landscape introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments | end state three customers enjoy individually tailored experiences but may lose track of spending while banks gain power as they track a customer’s entire payment profile implications for customers  more bespoke solutions lead to individually tailored payment experiences  however more fragmentation may lead to difficulty tracking spending due to many sources of payments implications for merchants  tailored payment experiences with loyalty rewards encourage app usage and may lead to more customer adoption increasing fragmentation implications for intermediaries  credit card fees continue or even rise as more credit card usage gets built into apps  however nascent data monetization platforms largely fail due to a lack of information sharing  as a result consolidation may occur as it is required to collect/make sense of customer data  as customers struggle to manage spending habits tools that offer tracking and advice could thrive implications for card issuers  the base act of card issuing does not largely decline in revenue – cards continue to compete on rewards  banks have the only complete picture of the customer’s spending thus retaining control over data introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion payments | conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions data monetization new competition and increased regulation will continue to make core payment activities less profitable pushing payment providers to focus on data monetization as an important source of revenue. data streams will be significantly more valuable where they are granular (e.g. product‐level data) and multidimensional (e.g. location data) making data cooperation and partnerships critical to successful monetization local payment needs instead of designing payment solutions based on technology institutions will focus on how their customers prefer to pay and design payment solutions that fit their customers' lives – which will lead to regional solutions. furthermore emerging countries without a mature payments ecosystem will likely take the lead in developing payment solutions power of large merchants as the ability of large merchants to influence their customers' payment choices grows (particularly in online transactions) their negotiating power within the payments ecosystem will grow accordingly. combined with the increased importance of product‐level payments data merchants will be able to wield this power to lower fees and influence the broader evolution of payments ecosystems introduction

potential to dramatically change its future circa the major forces impacting insurance were … value chain pressure new product needs increasing connectivity from sales to claims insurers faced pressure on all sides of the value chain new risks linked to changing lifestyles and technology meant new insurance product needs insurers’ ability to connect with and monitor their customers’ risks was increasing circa the big uncertainties about the future of insurance were … would the pressures on the insurance value chain continue and would they lead to changes? would insurance products change due to changing customer lifestyles? would connected products reach mass adoption across all types of insurance? how would the development of life insurance evolve as growth markets shift?

different channels such as online and mobile while others are changing their purchase occasions including purchasing microinsurance products as needed and purchasing insurance directly tied to a product shifting underwriting responsibilities the continued development of self‐driving cars and the sharing economy has started to shift the responsibility of insurance away from the insurer to both distribution platforms and product manufacturers (e.g. uber airbnb or tesla) creating new engagement models for insurers and necessitating a shift in insurance product design overcapitalization the insurance industry is overcapitalized as a whole leading to lower returns. thus the recent growth of non‐catastrophe insurance‐linked securities (ils) as well as partnerships between ils and risk underwriters/product designers will lead to additional return depression forcing firms to find other ways of unlocking profit rise of partnerships with the rise of external forces insurers and

between the consumer and a business is blurring with the rise of the prosumer meaning that consumers need different coverages depending on what they’re doing. as a result insurers must shift their delineation between personal and commercial insurance in order to meet customer needs micro‐insurance insurtech start‐ups are offering ever smaller “slices” of insurance for individual products (e.g. customers’ mobile phones) or for smaller amounts of time that customers can choose (e.g. for a potentially delayed flight). this will test the limits of insurance product design and necessitate on‐demand sales adaptable insurance consumers are demanding modularity for their insurance in different locations for different use cases (e.g. coverage for high‐value items) and for different usage patterns (e.g. coverages that can easily be turned on and off). as a result incumbents will have to adapt their “one‐size‐fits‐all” products to remain competitive introduction findings a b c d e

are proliferating but insurers have failed to convince customers that connected insurance serves their interests (p&c/life) the number of connections between the consumer and the insurer has risen but consumers do not feel comfortable volunteering their information as insurers have not convinced the customer of the benefits of connectedness supporting evidence customer data ownership as the amount of data from connected insurance rises regulatory bodies have started to mandate consumer data protection policies which put control of data in the customer's hands. moreover regulators in some locales are working directly with companies in order to ensure data security the rise of time‐measured insurance traditionally insurance products have worked on a fixed‐time basis where the price would be directly linked to the customer's risk profile. as technology advances connected insurance products can measure both a risk and a time variable making more targeted and accurate pricing possible ease of connection to simplify the process of connected insurance and to reach out to sometimes hesitant consumers insurers can work with product manufacturers to build the connection into the product. in most instances however that connection requires customer agreement role of assistants with increasing use of virtual assistants by amazon google and microsoft and as such assistants

d e uncertainties end states conclusion insurance | key uncertainties the resolution of these uncertainties will shape the future development of insurance and the roles of insurers what we know the insurance findings illustrate the scale of the challenges facing insurers. the value chain is under enormous pressure and changes in purchasing patterns are forcing insurers to move away from the traditional “one‐size‐fits‐all” model towards a flexible customizable range of products. at the same time insurers must change from being reactive to being proactive with the rise of connected insurance and the need to monitor customer risk on an ongoing basis. through these findings the following key uncertainties around the future of insurance emerged: uncertainties how will the insurance consumption model change as the sources and nature of liability changes in the future? will the industry be able to develop guidelines for the use of data and how will those guidelines differ around the world? do customers want to engage with their insurer more often (as would be needed for micro‐insurance)? how will insurers match their life products to fit the different conditions in emerging markets? will increasing integration and a focus on prevention lead to success for connected products? possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints four diverging pictures of the future of the insurance industry: challenging the channel underwriting by machine rise of the flexible product e‐z life insurance introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance | potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms changing the channel underwriting by machine rise of the flexible product e‐z life insurance the first end state paints a world where:  insurers improve their customer‐facing digital experiences  insurance becomes increasingly integrated with products  consumers benefit from products tailored to their needs  advertising for mindshare decreases in importance the second end state paints a world where:  underwriting becomes increasingly complicated strengthening the role of ai  third‐party underwriting (for ai expertise) becomes the industry standard  two diverging paths are created for customers  insurers face a battle to differentiate themselves the third end state paints a world where:  prosumers force insurers to connect business and personal insurance  insurers use technology to enable time flexibility  insurers engage with consumers to monitor coverage the fourth end state paints a world where:  insurers develop digital channels for product distribution  term products rise in popularity as demographics shift  life insurers deprioritize agents and investments  customers may be caught off guard by inconsistent coverage  life insurers thus increasingly resemble p&c firms introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance | end state one as customer purchasing patterns start to shift insurers emphasize benefits digital channels and integration at point of sale (p&c) insurtechs (backed by reinsurers) capture a noticeable share of the property and casualty insurance market by focusing on benefits to their customers and by offering superior onboarding and claims processes incumbent insurers are thus forced to change their products to allow for more customization and build purchase processes that are both simple and customizable both incumbents and insurtechs also seek to capture customers at the point of sale focusing on partnerships with product makers and distributors by integrating insurance into products customers focus much less on mindshare when making a purchase instead selecting products that best fit their work and lifestyle critical conditions early signs  digital channels for purchase continue to rise in popularity led especially by insurtechs  a variety of insurtechs that offer different types of p&c insurance appear driving competition  a majority of customers overcome apathy to consider switching insurance providers more actively  significant demand exists for insurance tied to specific products  incumbents start offering modular products on more lines of business introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance | end state one as a result product design and marketing will shift considerably and customers will benefit from having products more tied to their needs implications for incumbent insurers  insurtechs will set customer expectations on digital purchase and claims experiences  tie‐ins with products create opportunities for lucrative partnerships for leading insurers in this area  as products become targeted to customer needs using advertising to secure mindshare will become less important to customer acquisition implications for regulators  the rise of insurance tied to product sales compels regulators to answer questions about whether exclusive partnerships are good for customers changing the channel implications for insurtechs  the mainstreaming of insurtechs focused on customer‐specific experiences will benefit customer choice but may force the insurtechs into niches  mainstreaming will also attract willing partners and create opportunities to white label products implications for customers  customers will benefit from products tailored to their needs  customers who are heavy users and thus benefit from one‐size‐fits‐all insurance may have to pay more introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance | end state two insurers find it hard to keep up with rapid developments in ai and thus outsource underwriting causing a bifurcation of the market (p&c) the amount of technological sophistication needed to run an insurance company rises as algorithms take over underwriting to manage the technology insurers partner with a wide selection of vendors for their expertise in underwriting analytics effectively outsourcing underwriting as underwriting becomes outsourced it loses its value as a differentiator and insurers focus on differentiating themselves based on customer service and scale alternatively some insurers seek to pursue specialized slices of the market offering affinity products that appeal to a narrow range of consumers critical conditions early signs  ai development in underwriting advances significantly  insurers work with b2b vendors/utilities instead of in‐house especially to drive advancements in underwriting  insurers start cutting staff in underwriting departments as they outsource/depend on vendors  insurers start offering affinity policies introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance | end state two customers benefit but new entrants (especially affinity players) may suffer from lack of scale; in addition insurers have to find new ways to differentiate themselves implications for incumbent insurers  distribution and scale are more important than ever increasing the likelihood of consolidation  pooling of risks ceases to exist as pricing sophistication leads to individualized risk‐based pricing  non‐scale incumbents must find ways of differentiating themselves implications for regulators  the externalization of underwriting could mean fewer models to monitor but it also creates the risk of a “single point of failure” underwriting by machine implications for insurtechs  insurtechs catering to affinity customers face competition from insurers that seek to specialize  some insurtechs may evolve to become b2b underwriting and claims processing providers implications for customers  customers either benefit by paying less or by being served better under an affinity introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance | end state three the rise of insurance that covers changes in behaviour role and risk profile over time means insurers must solve how to monitor products (p&c life) consumers’ insurance needs are becoming more specific as their jobs and activities drive frequent changes to their risk profile and coverage needs the rise of part‐timers and prosumers means that insurers have to introduce flexible coverage forcing them to connect their business and personal lines the rise of product‐specific insurance (e.g. for a bike or phone) also means that insurers have to be smarter about measuring and tracking product usage as a result insurers introduce time‐flexible and event‐driven policies engaging with customers to find the best ways to control when insurance coverage is turned on and off critical conditions early signs  the shift towards self‐employment continues around the world  connected products that allow monitoring of “turn on turn off” insurance grow in popularity  insurers start entering into partnerships or acquisitions with prosumer‐focused insurtechs  insurers and gig economy firms launch partnerships to cover workers  insurers work to build in coverage for internet‐enabled products introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance | end state three incumbents and insurtechs would have to invest in tracking and digital solutions to protect against customer mistakes that lead to miscoverage implications for incumbent insurers  the increase in monitoring signals a fundamental shift in the role of insurers from risk transfer to risk monitoring and management  “turn on turn off” insurance means insurers will have to invest in monitoring technologies implications for regulators  using connected tools for monitoring customers will create new data concerns for regulators focused on consumer protection rise of the flexible product implications for insurtechs  the rise of flexible insurance means that insurtechs specializing in prosumers or connected products will have many partnership opportunities  insurtechs will have to carefully measure claims rates for fraud detection implications for customers  customers will benefit from flexible insurance products that can be modified to suit their needs  insurance that can be turned on and off may lead customers to struggle with inadvertent coverage gaps introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance | end state four demographics and market maturity mean emerging markets will provide the bulk of life insurance growth and digital distribution is key (life) growth in life insurance comes from younger customer bases in emerging markets that have different needs and a familiarity with digital channels however current models of growth in these markets revolve around hiring more agents to sell on the ground adding to costs and missing an opportunity to deploy digital tools leading insurers shift their focus away from retirement to short‐term increasingly flexible products matching the needs of people in emerging markets the rise of term products means insurers also focus more on digital channels of distribution which aligns with shopping patterns in many emerging markets critical conditions early signs  increasing demand for life insurance in africa south‐east asia and south america drives life insurers’ profits  insurtechs push incumbents by offering digital life insurance products in key locales  the lack of knowledge about complicated life insurance products persists  current demographic patterns continue  a global life insurer undergoes major restructuring (i.e. de‐ emphasizing agents) in key locales  \"simple” term products become increasingly popular introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance | end state four insurers that can offer digital distribution without compromising underwriting stand to capture market share and provide customers with additional coverage implications for incumbent insurers  the shift to term products and digital distribution means life insurers will start looking much like p&c insurers in their structure  this shift will foster industry consolidation as companies seek scale to drive profits from lower‐margin term products implications for regulators  the rise of digital channels may mean a more attractive target for data theft – regulators will have to ensure adequate data protection e‐z life insurance implications for insurtechs  insurtechs will have a competitive advantage in emerging markets due to their local nature and could represent good targets for acquisition  they can be a useful tool for spreading innovations between borders either organically or with a partner's help implications for customers  customers will benefit from products that better suit their age demographic (e.g. term life products) introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion insurance | conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions value chain shift once tightly vertically integrated the insurance value chain is rapidly being modularized by new technologies that allow for splitting activities across many different players. leading organizations are using this modularity to their advantage pursing flexible partnerships that allow them to aggressively compete for adjacent profit pools complex products simply distributed to remain competitive insurers need to simultaneously achieve two seemingly contradictory objectives: on the one hand they must develop complex and highly personalized products to meet customers’ needs; on the other they will need to significantly simplify the origination process enabling even highly complex products to be sold directly through online and mobile channels connections changing the insurer connected insurance will fundamentally change the way insurers operate shifting their focus from risk assessment to risk prevention and creating the imperative to work with original equipment manufacturers to build in connections. to achieve this however insurers must overcome existing perceptions of connected insurance products convincing customers that they represent an improvement over current products introduction findings uncertainties end states

regulators and driven by a desire to more efficiently satisfy customer needs platform banking business models – where banks offer connections with other firms in addition to their own – are gaining momentum supporting evidence increasing technology capacity increasing regulatory pressure shrinking margins apis as software intermediaries that allow programmes to connect and interact provide exposure‐specific functionality while protecting the rest of the application. this technology which has achieved broad adoption in recent years allows banks to seamlessly integrate with third parties and is necessary for developing platform models of banking regulators in a number of jurisdictions have begun mandating that banks share data and access with third‐ party organizations via open apis. these open banking standards such as psd2 in europe are expected to weaken banks’ control over customer data and allow customers much greater control over third‐party access to their accounts margins on banking products are declining due to increased competition lowering the profitability of product manufacturing. this incentivizes banks to refocus on distribution and seek partnerships with specialized product and service providers – in effect creating platforms for their customers caveats uncertain economics platform banking business models are nascent and little is understood about what the model and economics will ultimately look like. the uncertainty has discouraged incumbents and financial services software providers from investing in platform banking solutions particularly

agricole europe’s third‐largest bank by assets provides an app store for its customers to download a wide range of functionalities which complement core products. to do this the bank exposes its api to all external developers and cultivates a community that encourages customers to suggest ideas.2 rise of apis in financial services key uncertainties the degree of platform “openness” will depend on how many regulators enforce open banking standards and how strongly they do so will other governments pass regulations requiring the open sharing of data? will there be a “hard” or “soft” enforcement

legacy infrastructure creates challenges in meeting customer needs banks have undertaken significant efforts to move to a newer cloud‐based architecture but still struggle with legacy infrastructure that weighs down profits and limits banks’ ability to meet customer needs supporting evidence infrastructure issues core technological systems of financial institutions are largely built on decades‐old infrastructure (using extinct languages e.g. cobol) and are riddled with inefficiencies. as a result many incumbents are investing in \"integration layers\" to bridge the needs of client‐facing systems with their core system. while these layers have proven valuable banks are also aware of the need to migrate away from legacy cores patchwork solutions start‐ups are able to begin with the client experience and build an infrastructure specially designed for the client. in contrast incumbent financial institutions must often build ad‐hoc solutions to meet specific needs providing a short‐term solution but adding to the complexity of subsequent changes and the eventual modernization of their systems gradual shift to modernization incumbent financial institutions are shifting away from strategies to “rip and replace” legacy systems towards a gradual migration of functions to the cloud in order to improve flexibility and reduce costs. however the process of migrating away from legacy systems will take years and large amounts of capital and may prompt reliability issues introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking |

traditional deposit accounts despite significant efforts from online and mobile challenger banks a number of these banks have appeared in recent years; however these challenger banks have largely failed to gain market share especially with more profitable customer segments supporting evidence value of physical presence customers’ preferences are quickly shifting to digital channels but physical branches remain a critical component of the banking experience. many customers have banking needs which only physical locations can currently fulfill (e.g. getting a same‐day wire transfer for a home purchase) while other customers prefer a channel based on human interaction poor challenger bank economics because challenger banks are unable to meet more complex needs they tend to be used as secondary bank accounts by most customers causing them to lose out on a large share of revenue. also to attract customers they often provide either lower fees or higher returns on deposits than incumbents both of which lower profitability incumbents targeting attractive customers ability to fast follow the profitability of many customer segments declined following the financial crisis as wealth levels fell and interest rates approached zero. in response incumbents refocused their efforts on optimizing their client base – retaining their most profitable customer segments and ensuring that only less profitable customers would be tempted to switch to challenger banks very few technological barriers to entry affect the development of an online or mobile challenger bank (the majority of the barriers concern regulation). thus if customer defections to challenger banks accelerate incumbents can quickly follow with visually appealing front‐end offerings or an online bank of

company introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking | key uncertainties the future of digital banking will be impacted by the unravelling of uncertainties around regulation increasing digitization and the behaviour of technology giants what we know fintechs are now setting the level of expectations that customers have for banks. with the emergence of platform banking models banks are trying to evolve but are weighed down by legacy systems. however though fintechs may offer superior digital experiences consumers have yet to shift away from incumbent banks to online and mobile challenger banks. through these findings the following uncertainties around digital banking emerged: uncertainties will psd2 be a game changer for the industry in europe? will customer interest in open banking models continue in light of growing cyberinsecurity? what are the business models for large tech companies expanding into banking? how can incumbent banks transfer their competitive advantages to the digital world? what partners will banks choose to set out their long‐term digital strategy? possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints three diverging pictures of the future of the digital banking industry: controlled curated platforms tech aggregation platforms open platform world introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking | potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms controlled curated platforms tech aggregation platforms open platform world the first end state paints a world where:  banks outsource product design for less profitable products  banks form collections of best‐ of‐breed products from various sources  customers benefit from diverse and customized offerings  fintechs focus on white‐label and co‐branded products the second end state paints a world where:  large tech firms create distribution platforms  fintechs and smaller banks extend partnerships with large tech firms  customers embrace the ability to purchase from large tech firms  incumbents are forced to decide whether to join tech platforms or stay isolated the third end state paints a world where:  legislation or customer pressure forces banks to use open apis  third parties use apis to develop their own products  new entrants directly compete with traditional bank products  financial institutions choose to focus on single segments of the value chain introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking | end state one as banks focus on cost‐cutting they start embracing controlled curated platforms as a cost‐effective way of offering services as banks face margin pressures they make the decision to cut less profitable products and services in order to focus on differentiated offerings to fill the resulting gap banks approach fintechs and other service providers to form partnerships based on products over time banks form a small highly curated ecosystem of products and services – based on partnerships with other organizations – which they can then offer their customers customers benefit from access to best‐of‐breed offerings without having to switch banks but lack the choice they would have in an open platform critical conditions early signs  banks are not forced to develop open data solutions by regulators  banks make the decision to offer outside products to their customers instead of building in‐house  product designers are willing to make partnerships with banks for greater access to customers  banks form product‐level partnerships with fintechs to use the bank as a platform  open data regulations are not broadly adopted or are weakly enforced introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking | end state one controlled curated platforms give much greater power to the curator at the expense of customer choice implications for banks  banks get to choose the areas of banking they want to specialize in and can offer other features to their customers via partnerships  banks will need to ensure that they and their partners whether platforms or manufacturers provide a unified experience for customers implications for customers  customers benefit from best‐of‐breed products but have less choice than in other platform end states  customers face higher switching costs between product ecosystems controlled curated platforms implications for regulators  regulators must closely consider the market power of platform owners to ensure they are not using their position to distort market forces  regulators must also track the spread of customer data between platform owners and product manufacturers to ensure the data is handled and stored properly implications for fintechs  fintechs can partner with banks to extend their reach but lose out on control over distribution  fintechs can also use partnerships to broaden their suite of offerings and compete directly with banks more effectively introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking | end state two as fintechs and banks seek partners to optimize their value chain large tech firms start hosting significant distribution platforms large tech firms enter the digital banking sector not as product owners but as product distributors using their pre‐existing platform fintechs and smaller banks (especially those that focus on niches) form distribution partnerships with tech platforms allowing those banks to maximize their potential customer base customers already used to interacting with the tech firm embrace those aggregation platforms making them a best‐of‐ breed and more agile alternative to the traditional full‐service banking model seeing the popularity of these platforms large banks have a difficult choice to make: give up their exclusive distribution networks and join or risk missing out on a growing set of customers critical conditions early signs  big tech players choose to enter the distribution side of financial services  large tech players move upstream from infrastructure to providing software  big tech players are not plagued by a major scandal or data breach and remain trustworthy to engage with  regulators accept a more oligopolistic distribution of financial services products by tech firms  more regulatory sandboxes begin to develop and allow firms like facebook to operate in the financial area  tech firms (e.g. facebook) begin to offer simple financial services products backed by one or two partners introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking | end state two large techs expand into the financial services area intensifying their customer relationships and challenging regulators in preserving competition implications for customers  buying financial products from the tech provider of choice increases convenience for customers  as the aggregation platforms represent a shelf of cross‐entity products comparability and thus product quality may decrease implications for regulators  as the dominance of large tech firms extends into finance regulators need to consider the risk of market dominance even more strongly tech aggregation platforms implications for banks  banks would face a retail competitor with potentially broader reach and more resources meaning they would have to find competitive advantages  products and services previously bundled under the banking umbrella would become unbundled with only the regulated pieces staying with the bank implications for large tech firms  large tech firms would significantly increase their access to customer data sets introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking | end state three pressures force an open environment increasing competition and compelling incumbent institutions to focus on the most valuable segments banks are forced to develop and sell on open platforms as a result of open banking regulation or as consumers move to large tech platforms for the first time many third parties can compete directly against banks on a level playing field deploying products on the same platforms as banks do customers’ loyalty to a product provider falls as they shift to the banking product that suits them aided by the platform’s guidance financial institutions must choose to become a platform operator or product manufacturer as owning the entire banking experience from product to distribution becomes difficult critical conditions early signs  regulations force the development of open platforms; newly created open platforms gain enough customer support to force incumbents to participate  banks develop digital identity solutions and consistently deliver them  customers embrace platform banking overcoming their stickiness to one provider  regulators push back against the formation of closed curated platforms  customers flock to the development of open distribution platforms perhaps created by large tech firms  fintechs appear that are only focused on product design introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking | end state three power dynamics are shifting due to a more fragmented value chain as customers are benefitting significantly from increasing competition implications for banks  banks would be pushed to decide what role they wanted to play in the value chain: product distributor or platform manager  banks would lose the ability to cross‐ subsidize any of their products and thus would have to ensure profitability product by product  open platforms would mean that brand image becomes even more important than before and banks would have an advantage implications for customers  as the market becomes more competitive and client‐centric customers would be the main beneficiaries  however customers may be confused and overwhelmed by the choice of products implications for regulators  as legislations open up the playing field regulators need to clarify regulations for and grow comfortable with a materially different business model  the shift to open platforms raises the question of who is liable – the distributor or the product owner implications for new entrants  open platforms allow fintechs to bypass the problem of scale as platforms can provide access to many customers  new entrants without strong branding must find ways for their products to stand out open platform world introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking | conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions distributors or manufacturers? the rise of product platforms in digital banking will force market participants to make a choice between a strategic focus on product distribution (i.e. becoming the platform) or a focus on product manufacturing. this choice will have far‐reaching implications for their businesses and customer interaction models as well as for their competitive landscape fewer bigger winners the advantage of being the market leader will increase significantly for both product manufacturers and product distributors. platforms will offer customers improved transparency into products significantly increasing the advantage for the best products. for distributors significant economies of scale in access to data and customer awareness will feed a virtuous cycle of growth ecosystem imperatives under all possible end states digital banking institutions will forge more relationships with other financial services and increasingly non‐financial services firms – meaning that within the digital banking ecosystem a proficiency for establishing partnerships and a willingness to create win‐win symbiotic relationships will lead to more partners introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion digital banking | references references 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. “european challenger bank

techniques have significantly expanded access to credit for underbanked \"thin‐file\" and subprime customers new data and analytical techniques have proven valuable in adjudicating credit especially for “thin‐file” customers with insufficient credit bureau history to qualify for most loans driving a rapid expansion of credit to underserved markets supporting evidence new sources of data new sources of data have emerged for use in adjudicating credit such as social and mobile data for individuals and payments or accounting data for businesses. while this data has had limited effectiveness in improving the underwriting of established customers it has proven to be valuable for “thin‐file” borrowers (with insufficient credit bureau history) and small businesses using data more effectively incumbent lenders are looking to their existing stores of data to bolster their underwriting models especially for underbanked customers. however that data is often unstructured and siloed making it difficult to be put to use. to address these challenges incumbents are investing heavily in data transformation automation and new analytics more agile credit models new entrants improve on their credit models using short iteration cycles while incumbents are constrained to making adjustments much more slowly. this lag in implementing best‐in‐class methodologies provides new entrants a temporary competitive advantage in understanding the credit risk of underbanked and “thin‐file” customers especially as new sources of data become available caveats lack of credit cycles while credit

must add technological bridges to connect legacy infrastructure with the digital front ends demanded by customers. this additional effort increases development time and costs compared to fintechs but

non‐financial institutions are also jumping into the fray supporting evidence increasing customer engagement lenders are targeting non‐financial platforms because they provide access to the exact moments when customers need credit the most such as during supply chain management or the settlement of accounts receivable. thus lenders can pre‐emptively underwrite loans at “decision moments”

valuable forward‐looking insights into a company’s performance as well as enable detailed comparisons between similar businesses and individuals. as such this data helps to lower both underwriting risk and the cost of underwriting risk of new entrants non‐financial platforms have also begun their own exploration into providing lending products directly to their users as a new line of business.

marketplace lenders suffer from higher funding costs creating challenges in price‐sensitive segments and forcing them to explore other models supporting evidence high customer acquisition costs building a client base from scratch has proved to be expensive for new entrants particularly where they have relied on high‐cost analog channels such as direct mail. these higher customer acquisition costs have created particular challenges in segments where incumbents are well established and margins are low as incumbents already have a well‐defined client base and therefore a large cost advantage high funding costs for marketplaces while the absence of a branch network creates certain cost advantages for new entrants they are more than offset by significantly higher funding costs than for banks. while incumbent banks are able to deploy low‐cost deposits new entrants have relied on private investors who demand higher premiums to reflect a higher credit risk (perceived or otherwise) and a lesser‐known brand funding instability maintaining liquidity in a two‐sided marketplace has proved to be difficult. marketplaces initially sought hedge fund capital to fund growth but found this capital to be unstable as hedge funds pulled back due to broader market volatility. in response marketplaces are now exploring alternatives including acquiring banking licences which would

deloitte introduction findings a b c d uncertainties end states conclusion lending key uncertainties five key uncertainties arise from the lending findings which will shape this industry's direction what we know the lending findings illustrate how fintechs have altered customer perception of the lending experience. fintechs are using data to provide customers with pain‐free lending services and customers want the same efficient seamless experience with their banks. additionally consumers can choose from a multitude of financial and non‐financial providers. however fintechs are struggling to find a sustainable business model in the face of funding instability. through these findings the following uncertainties around lending emerged: uncertainties how much more effective will underwriting become with new sources of data and analytical techniques? will platform‐based lending emerge to become a relevant distribution channel? what is the long‐ term impact of marketplace lenders licensing their underwriting technology? will marketplace lenders move to provide direct lending? how will the borrower’s preference of distribution channels continue to evolve? possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints three diverging pictures of the future of the lending industry: different evolutionary paths shared service providers distribution 2.0 introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending | potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms different evolutionary paths shared service providers distribution 2.0 the first end state paints a world where:  marketplace lenders are challenged as funding costs rise  marketplaces further specialize and target niche areas  other marketplace lenders seek to become banks  customers benefit especially in niche areas the second end state paints a world where:  certain marketplace lenders become b2b service providers  banks find service providers more capable and cost‐ effective than their own internal functions  service providers flourish and become indispensable  the industry’s cost base becomes commoditized the third end state paints a world where:  lenders form partnerships with non‐financial firms  non‐financial firms use their platforms to originate loans  lenders begin to offer more customized products using additional data  consumers benefit from loans at the point of need introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending | end state one marketplace lenders have to further develop sophisticated capabilities or compete on price with established banks marketplace lenders are challenged in their attempts to scale up as their former competitive advantages of speed service and underwriting accuracy are commoditized some marketplace lenders shift their focus to niche products and to clients currently underserved by large banks other marketplace lenders choose to compete head on with established banks acquiring banking licences and retail deposits to lower and stabilize their funding costs as a result the marketplace lending model evolves itself away as firms either chase niche markets become banks or go out of business entirely critical conditions early signs  marketplace lenders fail to emerge as dominant players in non‐ niche markets  incumbent banks are able to sufficiently lower operating costs quickly enough to outperform marketplace lenders  the growth of marketplace lenders continues to be weak  some marketplace lenders expand into new products and customer segments  other marketplace lenders shift to acquire banking licences introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending | end state one clients will benefit from more sophisticated niche lending and increased competition as the lending landscape becomes more fragmented implications for incumbents  competition increases for niche areas but overall competition decreases as marketplace lenders become less competitive  marketplace lenders become a regular venue for banks to deploy excess capital implications for regulators  awareness is required of risks stemming from increased consolidation as incumbents gain market share  regulators must define the rules for edge cases as lending firms try to adapt their business model becoming more like a bank different evolutionary paths implications for alternative lenders  alternative lenders have access to much smaller sections of the market as they cede market share to banks  convergence with digital banking fintechs could lead to increased competition  significant growth occurs across new niche markets implications for customers  customers benefit from expanded availability of credit to underserved markets introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending | end state two the desire for cost‐commoditization drives growth in b2b service providers as two needs come together in one solution offering faster loans and leveraging nontraditional underwriting methods marketplace lenders shift customer expectations on what to expect from the loan experience however marketplace lenders largely fail to gain sufficient scale to overcome their considerable disadvantages in funding costs and struggle to remain viable meanwhile banks operating on expensive legacy cost bases with limited capabilities find partnerships with service providers to be the best delivery approach as a result some marketplace lenders choose to work with banks as b2b service providers and banks outsource the majority of their lending technology to marketplace lenders critical conditions early signs  regulators buy in to shared‐service models between competitors  a critical mass of financial institutions using shared service and external providers is reached  lending margins continue to erode  specialized capability providers that successfully deliver absolute cost advantages proliferate  connectivity between capability providers and banks becomes standardized  businesses develop adjacent to shared services (e.g. “rating agencies” for vendors) introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending | end state two increasing externalization improves industry cost bases but creates potential new points of systemic risk implications for incumbents  externalization leads to significant reductions of in‐house middle and back office functions  many in‐house capabilities that have set apart banks from competition are no longer differentiators  increased capacity from software‐as‐a‐ service providers makes it expenditures more of a variable cost decreasing the benefits of scale implications for regulators  the rise in b2b providers potentially increases the systemic risk of a single point of failure  granularity increases and service providers face more intense regulatory scrutiny shared service providers implications for alternative lenders  as lenders’ business models move from b2c to b2b the capabilities required for success shift significantly  non‐financial firms expand into lending as barriers to entry fall potentially leading to a return to the era of personal credit issued by retailers implications for customers  more competition on service and costs as “high‐quality execution” becomes commoditized  lower loan costs as bank operating expenses decrease  market fragmentation drives an intense battle for mindshare introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending | end state three non‐financial firms move horizontally into financial services and disintermediate the traditional broker channel as lending becomes commoditized lenders look for new opportunities to acquire potential customers and high‐ quality data on their current customers lenders form partnerships with non‐ financial platforms to use their data and offer loans through their user interfaces lenders improve the sophistication of their underwriting using their partners' data to make highly targeted offers that anticipate customer needs non‐financial platforms effectively replace the traditional broker channel and derive additional customer loyalty from having customers locked in to their ecosystem critical conditions early signs  connectivity between the non‐financial firm and the bank allows banks to receive data from and to offer loans through the platform  data provided by non‐financial firms is considered better than from other sources in adjudicating credit  small and medium‐sized businesses increasingly adopt cloud‐based software solutions  more non‐financial firms begin to move into the financial services area either on their own or through partnerships with existing lenders introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending | end state three as partnerships between banks and non‐financial firms proliferate customers’ experience improves and choices become numerous implications for incumbents  the rise of platforms as intermediaries means incumbents move further away from their customers  some platforms may act as aggregators and allow for comparisons thereby increasing price competition  incumbents acquire a better understanding of clients as they gain access to a new and deeper pool of non‐ financial data implications for regulators  regulators need to monitor new non‐ financial distribution channels and potentially regulate previously unregulated parties distribution 2.0 implications for non‐financial firms  such firms develop a new source of revenue as platforms receive fees in exchange for access and data  they proactively provide funding to clients directly “in‐app” thereby increasing customer interaction and providing more pull into the platform  the firms have a deeper relationship with their banks and more bargaining power in negotiations implications for customers  customers benefit from an improved experience: loans are available directly in app and customers know in advanced whether they are approved  customers have improved comparability of financial products and access to multiple providers introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion lending conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions the lowest funding costs win despite innovations in origination and adjudication the online lending model is fundamentally limited by high and unstable funding costs in its ability to compete with banks. the need for a consistent funding source at a cost similar to that of deposits for banks will drive online lenders to acquire banking licences – unless an alternative funding source can be found lending goes digital marketplace lenders and technology firms have reoriented customer expectations. leading lenders are expected to offer simple credit origination experiences where a combination of design and automation provides customers with a frictionless application experience and a swift response lenders use data effectively leading lenders are using data to improve both the effectiveness and the efficiency of their adjudication processes. they employ new sources of data to underwrite applications whose risks could not previously be assessed (e.g. ”thin‐file” customers) and reduce underwriting costs by automating the collection and analysis of key data (e.g. using data collected directly from a small‐business accounting platform). moving forward lenders will increasingly look for new signals/data to inform lending decisions introduction findings uncertainties end

outsource back office processes such as regulatory monitoring circa the big uncertainties about the future of investment management were … was robo‐advisory service truly the right answer for the vast majority of customers? how would companies look at b2b externalization as margins continued to decline? would monoline fintechs be able to capture significant market share? note: “wealth managers” are defined as organizations that provide advice and distribute products to customers in investment management. “asset managers” are companies that “manufacture” the financial product itself which forms

targeted to individuals as opposed to institutional investors increasing regulation raising costs regulators have stepped up efforts to protect retail investors citing mis‐selling scandals rising investor dissatisfaction and the shifting of retirement burdens from institutions to individuals. an unintended consequence of these polices has been to increase the cost of providing customers with individualized offerings through traditional channels making robo‐advisors a compelling solution rising client expectations customers have become accustomed to customer‐centric offerings and service in non‐financial settings and expect their financial services experiences including wealth management to exhibit similar characteristics. robo‐advisory products offer a digital and customer‐centric

cost‐cutting growth in external service providers manufacturing margins are declining as demand shifts from high‐cost to low‐cost products and distribution margins are falling as robo‐advisors gain popularity. this pressure is driving incumbents to search for savings especially in the areas of the value chain that add the least value – the middle and back office enabled by technological advancements external service providers are growing and building a track record of success in driving efficiency. as these firms proliferate and allow asset managers to focus on the strategic aspects of investing they will be trusted with more and more functions that are central to the asset manager’s operations automation and ai replacing processes automation and ai are becoming more capable and

robo‐advisors have primarily attracted mass or mass‐affluent customers. coupled with their low fees these clients generate relatively low per‐customer revenue. these economics have proven challenging as customer acquisition costs are high relative to each customer's value making it difficult to be profitable low barriers to entry robo‐advisory offerings have proven to be relatively quick and

uncertainties end states conclusion investment management | key uncertainties uncertainties in investment management largely revolve around the nature of future investment products and the composition of the related value chain what we know these findings illustrate increasing client expectations and the importance of a personalized customer experience. as middle and back office functions are automated or externalized firms are forced to differentiate on high‐quality process execution and distinct tailored advice. customer stickiness and the high cost of new customer acquisition allow incumbents to benefit as successful fintech offerings such as robo‐advisors are quick and easy to replicate. through these findings the following uncertainties around investment management emerged: uncertainties to what degree will product manufacturers move upstream and disrupt distributors? how will wealth managers differentiate their robo‐advisory offerings? will clients continue to prefer low‐cost investments or will “guaranteed outcome” products become popular? how will the role of human advisers and their job requirements change? will product manufacturing be characterized by more or less scale? possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints three diverging pictures of the future of the investment management industry: certainty‐based offerings advice as a differentiator quality externalization introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management | potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms certainty‐based offerings advice as a differentiator quality externalization the first end state paints a world where:  retail clients have less access to traditional pensions  retail clients become a more attractive segment than institutional clients  robo‐advisors condition clients to expect certainty  asset management develops and delivers “guaranteed outcome\" products the second end state paints a world where:  clients especially millennials flock to robo‐advisors  algorithm‐driven interfaces expand across multiple asset categories  wealth becomes the primary point of interaction with financial institutions  data‐sharing agreements become much more important to understand consumers the third end state paints a world where:  more and more cloud and platform‐as‐a‐service providers emerge  benefits of scale erode as high‐ quality execution becomes the norm  much of the market gets consolidated into large firms that can afford differentiated technology  many specialized smaller wealth managers thrive by appealing to niche markets introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management | end state one growing profit pools in retail wealth lead to a renaissance of products guaranteeing a predefined outcome because of competition and a shift to low‐cost products lower margins on the institutional side drive the industry to increase its focus on individual investors employers’ shift to defined contribution programmes combined with the growth of the self‐employment economy means more people lack certainty about their retirement while calculators and visualizations may create the perception of certainty in the customer's mind traditional products still depend on market conditions and thus lack certainty wealth managers compete by delivering “guaranteed” or “semi‐guaranteed” products designed to offer increased certainty to customers critical conditions early signs  improvements in analytics and risk management provide more granular insights into the liabilities associated with guaranteed products  institutions and manufacturers would need to be comfortable taking risk on some balance sheets and holding capital against it  an operating model for breaking down barriers between insurance and wealth management/banking is accepted by regulators  the shift of pensions from defined benefit to defined contribution continues  partnerships form between product manufacturers insurers and gig‐economy firms introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management | end state one customers will profit from products offering increased certainty but strong partnerships are needed to manage risks implications for customers  products that offer guaranteed outcomes increase customer certainty about retirement  predefined and guaranteed outcomes prevent severe losses and are thus better options for risk‐averse individuals  the duality of goal‐based and value‐based propositions creates different segments of clients implications for wealth managers  the increasing importance of individual clients requires significant investment to distribute via mobile/online channels  human factors (e.g. synthesis decision‐ making) are becoming more important certainty‐based offerings implications for asset managers  individual demands allow product development and brand to become more important  the offering of guarantee‐based products makes proprietary risk management practices a key differentiator  increased risk requires stronger collaboration with wealth managers (distribution) and insurers (risk management) implications for regulators  the offering of guarantee‐based products requires corresponding regulation and supervision  more individual decision‐making requires more comprehensive financial education introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management | end state two based on significant improvements in robo‐advice investment advice becomes the primary driver of a client’s choice of institution as the entire industry embraces robo‐advisors firms increasingly find it difficult to differentiate their offerings – start‐ups in particular struggle due to the lack of a strong brand wealth managers look to differentiate their robo‐ advisors to capture additional market share including offering more sophisticated services such as cash flow management enhanced robo‐advisors touch all aspects of an individual’s financial health from loan repayments to insurance product selection as a result the enhanced automated adviser becomes the primary point of interaction for a client and the primary driver of a client’s choice of institution critical conditions early signs  the capabilities of robo‐advisors (e.g. cash flow management) are significantly improved  interoperability is established between products and services to allow for managing them through a single enhanced robo‐advisory system  advisers are able to secure access to a full view of relevant customer data including external data  core banking margins narrow increasing the relative importance of wealth management business units as a profit driver and a differentiator  the number of partnerships and acquisitions between incumbent institutions and robo‐advisors or other technology providers increases further introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management | end state two investment services will become more convenient but also less transparent for customers while the role of wealth managers becomes more critical implications for customers  sophisticated robo‐advisors coupled with customized advice and services improve experiences and outcomes for digitally savvy customers  the relationship with financial institutions becomes service‐based instead of product‐ based implications for wealth managers  highly automated ai‐driven advice requires significant investment in system integration for information  core competencies shift from process execution to more human factors (e.g. synthesis decision‐making)  the importance of data will lead to a focus on third‐party data‐sharing agreements advice as a differentiator implications for asset managers  power dynamics shift away from manufacturers and towards distributors as they control the customer relationship and mindshare implications for regulators  the need to interpret and regulate behaviour of algorithms and ai in the retail area increases especially regarding recommendations introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion investment management | end state three increasing cost pressures force firms to either rely on external service providers or gain the scale to invest in differentiated technology investor demand for low‐ cost advice and products accelerates driving down average revenue rates and incentivizing asset and wealth managers to lower operating costs external service providers quickly proliferate as they demonstrate success in lowering costs and improving capabilities external service providers mean small and large players have access to the same capabilities. this erodes the benefits of scale except for the very largest firms who can invest in differentiated technology the industry bifurcates into small firms that aggressively pursue niches and “giants” that leverage differentiated technology to offer superior products and experiences to the mass market critical conditions early signs  capability providers demonstrate the ability to offer similar levels of service at substantially lower cost  regulators are comfortable with increased outsourcing of core business functions  capability providers exhibit the necessary level of interoperability to make externalization efficient  incumbents are comfortable with cloud/platform‐as‐a‐service solutions  increasing numbers of utilities or b2b capability providers emerge  incumbents partner with capability providers as opposed to acquiring them introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion

differentiation of offering the ongoing industry‐wide automation and externalization of middle and back offices combined with the ubiquity of robo‐advisory offerings are commoditizing the investment advisory value proposition. consequently leading firms will seek to identify and invest in other ways of differentiating themselves to stand apart from competition in particular through deeper personalization of customer offerings advice‐driven customer guidance as robo‐advisors become more ubiquitous and more sophisticated leading investment management companies will look to use these capabilities to deepen their engagement with robo‐advisory customers drawing on new sources of data to deliver advice on all aspects of their financial lives. this will mark the start of a change in their role from robo‐investors to true robo‐advisors role of human advisers the human adviser will still be crucial when differentiating products especially for high‐net‐wealth customers but the role of such advisers will shift in leading companies from product selection to a focus on customer engagement emotional intelligence and decision support introduction findings uncertainties end states

entry of new forces that could potentially change the future of venture fundraising circa the major forces impacting equity crowdfunding were … mass crowdfunding expert‐led crowdfunding crowdfunding‐as‐a‐service uk‐based crowdfunding platforms were opened to unaccredited investors for the first time platforms advertised expert‐backed rounds to signal trustworthiness crowdfunding platforms began on a white‐label basis circa the big uncertainties about the future of equity crowdfunding were … could crowdfunding platforms prove that the “wisdom of the crowd” is superior to individual investors? could crowdfunding platforms continue to grow absent successful company exits? how could crowdfunding platforms attract larger (i.e. institutional) investors? note: in this chapter equity crowdfunding is considered to be early‐stage/seed investments in unlisted companies. it does not include crowdfunding models such as pre‐sales or the relatively recent appearance of initial coin offerings (ico’s) introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding | overview of findings equity crowdfunding is growing but the industry is still in its

introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding finding a crowdfunding platforms have grown rapidly driven by strong demand from both investors and entrepreneurs the venture fundraising market is more competitive than ever driven by a growing number of start‐ups and private market investors seeking alternatives to venture capital supporting evidence strong private market returns established start‐ups finding a more liquid venture capital market are choosing to remain private for longer to avoid burdensome disclosures and market scrutiny. this delay has resulted in greater returns flowing to private investors ultimately driving others to look for opportunities to participate in the area low seed‐stage funding rates venture capitalists are paying more attention to the growing pool of private companies with valuations above $1 billion and overlooking smaller firms creating a strong need for seed capital from individuals rise in entrepreneurship shifting attitudes towards entrepreneurship and the availability of new technologies that lower barriers to entry for start‐ups have resulted in an explosion in the number of tech‐based start‐ups

defining factor in the success of the equity crowdfunding ecosystem new regulations around the globe are helping to structure and add transparency to the crowdfunding industry as regulators attempt to balance investor protection with a desire to make platforms an attractive and accessible source of capital supporting evidence relaxed suitability requirements many regulators are encouraging the industry by relaxing private market suitability requirements to allow non‐accredited investors to participate. this ensures that limits against investment sizes and wealth levels do not unreasonably limit the pool of potential capital differing disclosure requirements regulators have generally taken a light‐touch approach with respect to disclosure requirements allowing for a process significantly less onerous than for public firms. however certain jurisdictions have imposed harsher rules deteriorating the caliber of start‐ups on platforms as only those truly desperate for capital put themselves through such a process regulatory divergence crowdfunding regulations have diverged globally as different jurisdictions view equity crowdfunding very differently and thus treat its risk profile differently. this hampers the ability of platforms to expand and operate internationally limited deal size regulators have capped deal sizes to allow platforms to lead seed and a rounds. if set too low these risks significantly reduce crowdfunding’s value to entrepreneurs seeking larger funding rounds introduction findings b b c d uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding |

crowd has driven valuations higher than those seen in venture capital markets creating the risk that investors become disillusioned due to disappointing returns in the future supporting evidence lack of resources and time unlike angel and venture capital investors crowdfunding platforms do not have the institutional knowledge and time to invest a sizeable amount of effort in due diligence instead performing simpler diligence and relying on the wisdom of the crowd inexperienced investors many large platforms allow non‐accredited investors to participate in equity fundraising. those inexperienced investors drive valuations high in early rounds and are more likely to invest in less viable start‐ups creating problems in later rounds. moreover investors’ personal affiliations with brands can often play an outsized role in their investment decisions ai and cognitive solutions there is strong interest in leveraging new forms of data and the powers of automation and ai to perform

introduction findings b c c d uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding | finding d equity crowdfunding remains disconnected from the broader financial system limiting its long‐term scalability although crowdfunding is an increasingly meaningful part of the sme funding landscape its momentum has recently slowed. to sustain growth platforms need to broaden their distribution strategies to institutional funding supporting evidence limited track records due to the immaturity of the platforms and the lack of an established track record investors have limited ability to gauge the risks and return expectations of their investments. thus they are reluctant to invest or in many jurisdictions are limited by investor protection laws lack of liquid secondary markets early‐stage venture capital investments are highly illiquid with investors unable to realize a return until the company goes public or is sold – often years after the initial investment. a liquid secondary market would allow investors an opportunity to exit; it also creates “signaling issues” for the start‐ups as stock temporarily trading down could impact the business’s prospect of raising future rounds of investment demand for pooled products researching and investing in individual stocks is largely a cottage industry for retail investors as the majority of individuals desire the simplicity and accessibility of pooled products. platforms have not yet developed more accessible products and could work with asset managers to do so wider distribution networks the majority of wealth is invested through financial advisers (both automated and human) and not through direct channels. equity crowdfunding platforms have not yet accessed wealth management distribution channels introduction findings

grow what we know the four equity crowdfunding findings illustrate the rise in demand for crowdfunding platforms the imperative role of regulation on crowdfunding success the challenges faced with the lack of investor knowledge and the difficulty of equity crowdfunding to integrate into the broader financial ecosystem. through these findings the following key uncertainties around the future of equity crowdfunding emerged: uncertainties how can platforms use emerging technologies (e.g. ai and machine learning) to educate investors and provide due diligence tools? what partnerships are important to developing new products and expanding distribution? how will regulators balance investor protection with ensuring that platforms remain an attractive source of capital? how will rates of entrepreneurship evolve as macroeconomic conditions change and industries mature? will shifting market conditions (e.g. rising interest rates) significantly impact investor demand for early‐stage equity? possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints three diverging pictures of the future of the equity crowdfunding industry: social driver international expansion shooting star introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding | potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms social driver international expansion shooting star the first end state paints a world where:  equity crowdfunding for profit‐ oriented companies never achieves profitability  social impact‐oriented crowdfunding builds on the success of debt instruments like social impact bonds  platforms differentiate themselves based on social returns and affinity groups  projects get sources of community support and feedback the second end state paints a world where:  regulations across jurisdictions are standardized  platforms start expanding internationally  new technologies allow inter‐ platform connectivity  secondary market trading allows platforms to attract additional investors and grow the third end state paints a world where:  continued low interest rate environments drive wealth managers to seek yield  partnerships with equity crowdfunding platforms are developed  ai and automation is used to analyse firms and investments  the crowdfunding market grows considerably as institutional money arrives introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding | end state one platforms fail to scale in profit‐oriented industries but catch on as vehicles to deliver social impact equity crowdfunding for profit‐oriented companies never rivals venture capital and angel investors; however it catches on as a way of investing in equity for socially worthwhile causes unable to scale platforms never become profitable but get government support through grants and tax programmes platforms differentiate themselves based on degrees of social and financial returns and their affinity group as well as on customer engagement and degree of due diligence social projects get valuable community support and feedback allowing the ecosystem to flourish critical conditions early signs  venture capital funds remain the dominant source of early‐stage start‐up funding  the number of investors interested in providing equity to social enterprises grows  government support for platforms continues through grants and tax advantages  high valuations and/or poor track records stifle platform growth and drive investors away from the industry  poor equity crowdfunding regulations are not fixed  quality start‐ups turn away from the crowdfunding platform and opt for venture capital funding instead introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding | end state one social enterprises attract more funding and are more impactful as the ecosystem becomes developed and dedicated social driver implications for individual investors implications for incumbents implications for entrepreneurs  individual investors receive access to a platform to invest equity in social causes they truly care about  they give valuable input to affinity and social‐focused projects that other sources of investment do not provide  angel investors and venture capital firms remain the dominant source of investment for private equity  start‐ups providing a social good have increased access to capital  start‐ups operating in less popular sectors for venture capital have fewer funding sources and/or are located in less liquid venture capital markets introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding | end state two regulator convergence allows for cross‐border investment and crowdfunding platform growth obvious market success in certain jurisdictions driven by regulation drives regulators in other jurisdictions to follow suit and standardize equity crowdfunding rules platforms start expanding internationally allowing investors in one jurisdiction to invest in others thereby increasing the pool of potential investors for the top start‐ups platforms invest in technologies that allow for inter‐platform connectivity and safe record‐keeping in order to encourage cross‐ platform investments with the market's growth a nascent secondary market can even be established for the most successful crowdfunded firms critical conditions early signs  increased collaboration between crowdfunding platforms and regulators across jurisdictions will help create standardized regulation for equity crowdfunding  investment in technology leads to building inter‐platform connectivity and due diligence tools for investors  increased pressure to regulate the industry results in new regulations and improved investor confidence in platforms  interest grows for firms in emerging markets to use crowdfunding because of limited venture capital opportunities and for investors in mature markets to invest in them  new tools emerge that allow investors to conduct due diligence introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding | end state two international expansion by crowdfunding platforms levels access to venture capital across geographies international expansion implications for individual investors implications for incumbents implications for entrepreneurs  investors have increased access to both domestic and global equity opportunities  portfolio diversification is improved by adding high‐risk and potentially high‐ return global investments  the number of later‐stage emerging market investment opportunities available to venture capital funds grows as equity crowdfunding supports firms through early‐stage growth  increased competition for venture capital firms is focused on underdeveloped markets  improved access to early‐stage capital in markets traditionally underserved by venture capital levels the playing field between established and emerging markets introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding | end state three crowdfunding platforms forge partnerships and gain scale to successfully lead late‐stage offerings traditionally done by venture capital firms a continuing low‐yield environment drives wealth managers to partner with platforms. the ecosystem develops new products and accesses established distribution channels (including robo‐advisors) platforms invest in automation and ai to assist start‐ups with preparing disclosures and make commercial due diligence available to investors at low cost platforms focus on the b2b market and relegate the b2c channel to prototyping new features. platforms grow and improve liquidity allowing them to lead larger offerings platforms grow considerably especially for early‐stage investments and even compete with venture capital firms in several markets – especially where venture capital is weak critical conditions early signs  a prolonged low‐return environment leads wealth managers to look for other higher‐yield opportunities  technology start‐ups develop advanced analytics tools that help wealth managers perform due diligence  early tentative partnerships between wealth managers and platforms are successful  technology start‐ups emerge that focus on improving the early‐ stage due diligence process  platforms demonstrate some early successes and build track records  regulators accept partnerships with wealth managers introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding | end state three crowdfunding plays an increasingly large role for seed stage funding but individual investors only interact with crowdfunding through their wealth managers shooting star implications for individual investors implications for incumbents implications for entrepreneurs  investors gain the ability to allocate to high‐risk high‐return crowdfunded equity  engagement in the investment selection process decreases due to intermediation  early‐stage equity becomes a common source of diversification  crowdfunding platforms gain scale through partnership with wealth managers  due diligence technology leads to higher‐ quality opportunities through better detection of “bad eggs”  venture capital firms focus on later‐stage opportunity because of increased competition at the seed stage  both early‐ and late‐stage start‐ups have improved access to venture capital/liquidity  barriers are lower when accessing platforms because due diligence is cheaper (handled by platforms) but more information is needed to pass due diligence introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding | conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions improved liquidity at seed stage leading crowdfunding platforms will increase the amount of seed‐stage funding available to entrepreneurs thus filling a valuable niche in the fundraising ecosystem especially in parts of the world with less venture capital investment regulator balance regulation plays a significant role in shaping the equity crowdfunding industry across all possible end states whether crowdfunding platforms go direct to consumers or partner with incumbents. regulators must balance encouraging crowdfunding and ensuring adequate due diligence integration with broader financial ecosystem in order to achieve a sustainable level of scale equity crowdfunding platforms will need to grow their scope of funding through integration with the broader financial ecosystem (e.g. incorporation into wealth management platforms) and will need to establish secondary markets with sufficient liquidity note: due to their relative recency icos were not in the scope of this initiative but they represent a new mechanism for crowdfunding that warrants further research introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion equity crowdfunding references references

continue their journey towards electronification driven by regulation and the promise of improved economies of scale the electronification of traditional otc asset classes (e.g. fixed income) has continued in recent years following the path of equity markets. however this process has been uneven with some product types moving away from otc faster than others supporting evidence data and standardization platforms are collecting demand/supply data to create an aggregated market view and aid discovery of suitable counterparties and are even providing additional market analytics to better inform buyers sellers and intermediaries. however securing data standards and cross‐platform interoperability remains key to avoid fragmentation and secure liquidity during the electrification process regulatory push some post‐financial crisis regulations have required particular asset classes to move their trade and post‐ trade processes to trading platforms (e.g. interest rate swaps).

otc trading under the best‐execution imperative asset class characteristics certain asset classes have characteristics that naturally make them better suited for trading platforms. products that are

question supporting evidence post‐crisis regulation platforms have been able to achieve scale quickly in the last few years by taking advantage of regulatory reforms (such as mifid or dodd‐frank in the united states) that were enacted in response to the financial crisis. as the crisis becomes a relic of the past regulatory bodies around the world are starting to revisit financial crisis‐era

institutions wait for clear signals on the priorities of newly formed governments regionalization the global regulatory trend over the last few decades has been one of increasing global

the development of new business models around those technologies supporting evidence erosion of margins as technological improvements lower economies of scale the profitability of operating a utility is declining. additionally utilities are under pressure from a prevailing low interest rate environment and increasing capital costs causing them to explore new profit opportunities data and data flow

industry cooperation between different data providers including complementary infrastructure and data‐sharing agreements value chain disruption capabilities new technology could lead to significant

most successful path to scaling up many fintechs have entered the trading platform area (23 new corporate bond platforms alone between and 2015) but a review of the survivors suggests that a mix of fintech technological innovation and incumbent scale is the winning bet supporting evidence monoline challenges trading platforms with a narrow asset class or value chain focus (i.e. most start‐ups) are struggling to meet the needs of incumbents who operate in many differentiated markets and thus look for efficiency and cross‐product synergies from their platforms incumbent adaptation incumbent banks brokers and platform providers can use available resources (both talent and financial) and the industry's high switching costs to their advantage. rather than adopt fintech solutions they can either develop their own or acquire promising start‐ups to bridge the gap stickiness even when significant efficiencies exist on new trading platforms two factors have created a strong stickiness for traditional trading methods: the desire of incumbents to limit the integration of new technology platforms due to switching costs and a reluctance to disturb the complex network of individual and institutional relationships characterizing capital markets ongoing need for improvement incumbents who provide market access to investors remain slow at improving customer‐friendly and cost‐ efficient technology‐driven relationship models due to inertia and a lack of expertise. therefore fintechs represent an ideal partner for enriching and improving core technology as well as continuously improving customer interfaces introduction findings findings a a b b c c d d uncertainties uncertainties end states end states conclusion conclusion market infrastructure | finding d new market

findings findings a a b b c c d d uncertainties uncertainties end states end states conclusion conclusion market infrastructure | key uncertainties uncertainties around market infrastructure largely concern the future direction of regulation and the impact of new technologies on the industry what we know the four market infrastructure findings illustrate the increasing role of platforms in capital markets. traditional otc products are becoming more and more electronified but are hindered in their efforts to scale up due to fragmented regulatory and technological environments. in order to scale up and garner success joint ventures and partnerships between fintechs and incumbents are key. through these findings the following key uncertainties around the future of market infrastructure emerged: uncertainties what will political disruption and potential deregulation mean for platform trading and proliferation? how will buy‐side investor demand for innovation and new business models shape the platform universe? how far away are disruptive technologies such as ai and dlt from applicability and scalability in a production environment? what will drive the necessary cooperation to embed new business models into the existing ecosystem? how will disruptive technologies affect the value chain and individual roles in market infrastructure? possible futures the resolution of these five key uncertainties paints three diverging pictures of the future of the market infrastructure industry: platform proliferation data‐infrastructure collision new post‐trade value chains introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure | potential end states depending on how the key uncertainties are resolved the potential end states have very different evolutionary paths and implications for all firms platform success data‐infrastructure collision new post‐trade value chains the first end state paints a world where:  market platforms enhance their tools and standardize languages  trading in many asset classes becomes easier  market participants adopt platforms en masse  platforms continue to innovate as usage rises thus consolidating their market position the second end state paints a world where:  data‐focused firms expand within the platform area  infrastructure providers leverage information custody to provide data services  as a result those players find themselves on a collision course  users increasingly have fewer providers for both data and infrastructure the third end state paints a world where:  infrastructure providers disrupt the capital markets value chain  improvements (e.g. real‐time settlement) lead to new market structures  some entities leave the ecosystem while others redefine their role  additional resources are freed up by improvements to processes introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure | end state one new platform capabilities including pre‐ and post‐trade processes will accelerate their adoption across asset classes market platforms enhance their tools and standardize languages to provide more intuitive trading workflows streamline pre‐ and post‐ trade processes and improve interoperability at the same time technological advancements make connecting buy‐side firms easier and improves matching of products to customers making sell‐side firms less relevant as a result platforms become cheaper and more convenient to trade on heightening their attractiveness for participants the move to platform adoption accelerates with some surprising asset classes successfully moving onto platforms critical conditions early signs  a stable regulatory environment is favourable for market providers  buy‐side clients adopt and use platforms on a significantly larger scale  buy‐side firms start to partner directly with platform providers  increasingly more platforms create significant liquidity in production as volumes of transactions executed via platforms grow further and for more asset classes introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure | end state one the rise of additional platforms to facilitate trading increases pressure on incumbents to continue to improve benefiting the buy side implications for incumbent infrastructure providers  more platform usage means incumbents must further develop their existing platform solutions to protect market share  alternatively they could partner with emerging platforms or acquire them implications for regulators  regulators would increase their visibility into the market as platform usage grows allowing for greater tracing of activities platform success implications for new entrants  higher platform usage would direct traffic to innovative new entrants allowing them to gain market share  more platform usage would also contribute to platform interoperability and multilateral relationships benefitting new entrants implications for buy‐side customers  platforms would allow customers to become less dependent on sell‐side participants in the longer term introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure | end state two as infrastructure and data providers encroach on the other’s core businesses customers will likely have to choose between them traditional providers of data platforms (e.g. bloomberg) continue their expansion into execution and post‐trade processing deploying platforms for new asset classes meanwhile as margins in their core businesses erode traditional market infrastructure providers deepen their focus on monetizing their data flows with data platforms and market infrastructure providers on a collision course new points of competition will appear between them the competition creates both incentives and pressures for customers to reduce the number of partners as their data provider would likely operate the platforms they use critical conditions early signs  the trend towards electronification of asset trading continues and even increases in pace  platform infrastructure providers start focusing on hiring employees with a data background  the platform environment remains highly competitive and pure access to standard products represents a commoditized service  data and/or platform providers start offering customers incentives to use their company for trading and data  new technologies can be applied in enhanced data science (e.g. ai) and are coupled with robust monetization strategies introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure | end state two customers may have additional choice regarding partnerships leading to lower costs and will likely work with fewer partners implications for incumbent infrastructure providers  expansion may mean more partnerships with or acquisitions of data‐heavy fintechs to acquire competencies  regulatory questions may mean more partnerships to ensure easier risk management implications for regulators  additional data means more opportunities to monitor the market  however regulators will have to build connections with data providers an entirely new set of constituents data‐infrastructure collision implications for incumbent data providers  moving into the infrastructure field may mean new infrastructures with data at their core  additional competition may mean more partnerships with or acquisitions of platform fintechs to gain competencies implications for buy‐side customers  additional service providers may mean lower prices and additional benefits but one provider for both infrastructure and data  however the rise of data means some level of acceptance is needed that their data is no longer solely theirs to use introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure | end state three as incumbents invest in market infrastructure improvements the value chain will naturally shift leading to consolidation and role changes incumbent market infrastructure leaders start to invest in new infrastructure throughout post‐trade processes (e.g. shift to real‐time settlement) these improvements such as real‐time settlement allow infrastructure providers to disrupt traditional capital market value chains by offering more services and taking on larger roles as a result intermediaries focusing on only one service get pushed out and post‐trade facilities (such as central securities depositories) move from settlement towards oversight and trusted guarantor additionally improvements to the post‐trade structure frees up additional resources for capital market incumbents as less capital has to be held for risk management critical conditions early signs  significant investment in new technology by market infrastructure providers moves markets towards real‐time and flexible settlement  regulators accept new technology‐based business models or even ecosystems embed them into existing regulatory frameworks and define the nature of the relationship to existing ecosystems  new ecosystems are complementary on an international scale to reflect the global nature of capital markets  investment share in new infrastructure technologies rises constantly over the next five years  cooperative models on dlt ecosystems embrace growing numbers of industry stakeholders  the first distributed ledger system is launched in production by a bank or an exchange organization and linked to post‐trade activity introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure | end state three these improvements to the value chain will lead to significant savings for buy‐ side investors as cash flow management and risk management costs decline implications for incumbent infrastructure providers  new technologies allow incumbent providers to revamp existing business models playing a bigger role in the value chain  the need to offer more services (as they play a bigger role in the value chain) may mean consolidation to acquire expertise  ongoing consolidation is likely to result in an increasing number of utilities and consortia aimed at cost mutualization for non‐differentiating and commoditized activities (e.g. kyc or risk compliance) implications for regulators  improvements such as real‐time settlement may mean a more difficult role for regulators as there is less time for review new post‐trade value chains implications for fintechs  the changes to infrastructure mean that blockchain‐related or other real‐time focused firms will find many partners  however incumbents’ ability to own more of the value chain may make it harder for fintechs to gain market share implications for buy‐side customers  improvements to post‐trade settlement will allow for simple cash flow management and streamlined operations increasing profits in the long run introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure conclusion key takeaways for financial institutions insufficiency of technology alone new technological solutions alone are insufficient to enable the creation of new market infrastructure or to drive significant changes in existing infrastructure; this will make “minimum viable ecosystems” of cooperating stakeholders critical to development. leading players from both the public and private sphere will seek to actively participate in and shape the direction of these stakeholder groups navigating regulatory uncertainty differing regulatory direction around the world will likely lead to both regionalization and uncertainty in the short and medium term. financial institutions will need to develop the flexibility to rapidly adapt to both large‐scale regulatory changes and regionally divergent regulatory treatment of emerging‐market infrastructure technologies new value chain pressures and opportunities regulation and technological advancements are driving efficiencies which will put pressure on incumbents to consolidate their positions and thus shorten the value chain. forward‐looking firms will seek to position themselves in areas that will continue to add value including areas currently occupied by other firms introduction findings uncertainties end states conclusion market infrastructure references references 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. “deutsche börse buys into

executive summary the mandate of this project was to explore the transformative potential of new  entrants and innovations on business models in financial services project context we set out to address three major problems that have prevented a comprehensive understanding of the state of disruptive innovation in the industry:  there is no common taxonomy or understanding of which innovations are the most relevant  there is no clear understanding of the evolutionary path of emerging innovations  the implications of those evolutions on incumbent business models are unclear  creating significant uncertainty for traditional players as they strive to  react to growing competitive pressures we structured our research around three main questions  each requiring distinct actions: project approach which emerging innovations are the most impactful and relevant to the financial services industry? action: we identified 11 key clusters of innovations based on how they impact the core functions of financial services  how will these innovations impact the ways in which financial services are structured  provisioned and consumed in the future? action: we considered a range of scenarios for the degree and nature of impact each cluster of innovation could have what would be the implications of these changes on customers  financial institutions  and the overall financial services industry? action: we analysed  the implications of each scenario on customers  incumbent institutions and the overall financial services ecosystem over 15 months of research we engaged with industry leaders and innovators  through interviews and multi-stakeholder workshops industry leaders innovators  oversight  guidance and thought leadership from 16 c-suite executives  and 25 strategy officers of global financial institutions  in-person and phone interviews with 100+ innovative new entrants and subject matter experts  facilitated six multi-stakeholder workshops at global financial hubs with 300+ total participants including  industry leaders  innovators  subject matter experts  and regulators global workshops hong kong sar 4 sep. `14 tianjin  china 11 sep. `14

financial services  research framework we have structured our framework against six functions of financial services and eleven clusters of innovation. functions of financial services even in an environment of rapid change to the  design  delivery and providers of financial services   the core needs those services fulfill remain the  same. we have identified six core functions that  comprise financial services :    payments market  provisioning investment  management    insurance deposits &  lending capital  raising clusters of innovation we have identified 11 clusters of innovation exerting  pressure on traditional business models we have synthesised six high level insights on innovation in financial services key research findings innovation in financial services is deliberate and predictable; where the greatest sources of customer friction meet the largest profit pools incumbent players are most likely to be attacked  innovations are having the greatest impact where they employ business models that are platform based  data  intensive  and capital light  the most imminent effects of disruption will be felt in the banking sector; however  the greatest impact of disruption  is likely to be felt in the insurance sector incumbent institutions will employ parallel strategies; aggressively competing with new entrants while also  leveraging legacy assets to provide those same new entrants with infrastructure and access to services  collaboration between regulators  incumbents and new entrants will be required to understand how new innovations  alter the risk profile of the industry – positively and negatively disruption will not be a one-time event  rather a continuous pressure to innovate that will shape customer  behaviours  business models  and the long-term structure of the financial services industry in the following pages  we have summarised our insights by function and cluster this section provides a summary of our findings  divided by function and clusters within the functions. for each cluster of innovation we have defined  the major disruptive trends  summarized the impact  and examined key implications for institutions in that

become “prosumers” at the conclusion of the research phase  the steering committee gave us a  mandate to dive more deeply into high-potential areas of disruption next steps we have identified three major challenge areas related to innovation in financial services that will require multi-stakeholder collaboration to be  addressed effectively. we are launching a project stream related to each area  with the goal of enabling tangible impact. the forum is uniquely positioned to support advancements against each challenge due to its ability to:  convene senior multi-stakeholder groups and align diverse perspectives  create thought leadership on cutting-edge issues with long-term implications to the industry challenges projects new financial products and services are creating significant regulatory  uncertainty and fueling perceptions of regulatory arbitrage regulatory models  for innovation decentralised systems  such as the blockchain protocol  threaten to  disintermediate almost every process in financial services applications of  decentralised systems outdated identity management protocols create risks and  inefficiencies for both service providers and consumers blueprint

module detailed research modules payments how will customer needs and  behaviours change in an increasingly  cashless payments landscape? payments: cashless world executive summary context / innovation  a number of innovations have emerged in the past five years leveraging mobile devices and connectivity to make payments simpler and more  valuable. examples range from digital wallets to automated machine-to-machine payments  the majority of these innovations will modify front-end processes to improve the customer and merchant experience while leaving the underlying  payments infrastructure undisrupted future of payments  these innovations will reduce the use of cash and make payments less visible to payers. they will also enable financial institutions and merchants  to use data-driven customer engagement platforms ‒ as more payment solutions allow customers to link their bank accounts for direct payment and seamless point-of-sale vendor financing  the use  of credit cards could be displaced by these platforms ‒ customers may lose visibility into their payment choices  increasing their default cards’ share of wallet and reducing the importance of some  traditional differentiators like brand and design ‒ the elimination of a need to carry physical cards and the emergence of payment decision support systems could support the proliferation of  niche and merchant issued cards  splintering wallet share among many cards  key implications  success of any innovative payment solution will require a strong customer rationale to switch  as most customers do not consider the existing  payment regime to be broken   in an increasingly cashless future payment providers who can embrace emerging payment innovations to offer differentiated  value-adding digital  experiences will be able to deepen their relationships with customers and take a dominant place in the changing market landscape payments: cashless world the payments industry has continuously evolved over time  but there are still  some challenges to make the world cashless  since the introduction of credit cards in the 1950s  debit cards in the 1980s and the rise of e-commerce through the 1990s  electronic payments have  grown in popularity  displacing cash and cheques. in 2012 they accounted for 68 percent of u.s. transactions in value history of the payments industry  electronic transactions rely on a number of intermediaries  which provide acceptance  convenience and security of transactions  and are generally  coordinated by large scale-based payment networks customer point of sale (pos) acquirer merchant issuer payment network payment credentials /  authentication benefits of electronic transactions key challenges inhibiting the cashless world  convenience: reduces the need for customers and merchants to  carry cash  reducing associated costs  including trips to banks  price  inflexibility and opportunity costs (i.e.  interest earned)  efficiency: reduces the cash management costs for businesses and  financial institutions as fewer bills are exchanged by hand and money  movements are settled electronically  traceability: enables a greater degree of visibility into the flow of  money for financial institutions and regulators  facilitating taxation   transparency  and information gathering  protection: protects customers and merchants from fraud and theft by  documenting transaction records and reducing the need to hold cash merchant adoption electronic payments are not  accepted by every merchant due  to the infrastructure costs  high  fees and settlement delays convenience small denomination payments are  often still conducted reducing the  number of processing steps and  time to complete a transaction accessibility under-banked population does  not have access to primary  accounts and therefore only uses  cash in transactions fraud despite the safety measures  increasingly adopted  electronic  transactions create opportunities  for fraudulent activities payments: cashless world a number of payments innovations have emerged in the past five years   leveraging mobile and connectivity to make payments simpler and add value key innovations for the cashless world mobile payments integrated billing streamlined payments next generation security  mobile wallets  mobile-based merchant payment  solutions  mobile ordering & payment apps  integrated mobile shopping apps  location-based payments  (geotagging)  biometrics / location-based  identification  machine-to-machine payments  tokenisation standards order ahead common characteristics of successful payments innovations simplicity interoperability value-add services  payments innovations allow customers to  make payments in a single tap or  automatically by leveraging connectivity  (e.g.  wireless network  near-field  communications)  most innovative payment solutions are not  restricted to a single payment method   allowing customers to manage and use a  variety of credit cards  debit cards or bank  accounts for payment  many innovative solutions offer value-add  functionalities in addition to payments   enabling merchants and financial institutions  to interact more closely with customers and  deliver additional value (e.g.  loyalty  offers) payments: cashless world most payment innovations do not disrupt the existing payment processes  but  rather modify front-end processes to improve customer and merchant experience how different types of innovative payment solutions interact with today’s payment process how they work illustrative diagram examples open-loop mobile  payment solutions closed-loop mobile  payment solutions allows for increased consumer  access by using existing payment  network ecosystem to connect to  parties already on the platform  (including a large number of  merchants) and make payments  more convenient for customers  leveraging new form factors (e.g.   nfc  qr code) consolidates the pos  acquirer  and payment network as a single  entity to create a more flexible  experience  requiring consumers   issuers  and merchants to  participate. often allows  consumers to fund transactions via  the traditional payment network  ecosystem mobile merchant  payment solutions; integrated payment apps;  streamlined payment  solutions aims to replace or complement the  current pos infrastructure by  leveraging mobile connectivity  (and aggregate transactions in  some cases) to make the  payments process more effortless  and accessible by more merchants enhance customer pos acquirer merchant

authentication payments: cashless world innovations will make payments more cashless and invisible in the future  while  enabling data-driven engagement platforms for customers key characteristics of the future of payments cashless more cash will be displaced by electronic  transactions as payments innovations make it  beneficial for customers to use payment cards  even in small denomination transactions back of mind as more transactions become virtual and  automated  more payments processes will  become invisible to end customers  changing  their needs and behaviours engagement as payments and mobility becomes more  integrated  the importance of payment  transactions as a potential customer interaction  point will increase for merchants and financial  institutions data-driven with greater adoption of electronic payments   more data will be accumulated from payment  transactions  allowing financial institutions   services providers and merchants to gain  greater understanding of customers and  businesses increased access to loans as more payments are processed through  electronic rails  financial institutions’ visibility  into individuals’ and businesses’ cashflow and  spending patterns will increase  improving their  ability to extend loans to customers previously  less understood reduced costs because innovative solutions build on the  existing infrastructure  which has very low  variable costs  the cost of making electronic  transactions will fall as electronic payments  gain more volume as innovations change customer behaviours by making payments more effortless and provide  financial institutions and merchants with data  what will be the payments landscape in the future? payments: cashless world how will changing customer needs and

bank account key change to payment  behaviour  customers lose visibility into their payment  choices as innovations like amazon’s 1- click and uber’s seamless payments push  more and more transactions to a single  default card  the default cards’ share of wallet will  increase and the importance of  differentiators like card brand and design  will be reduced  the successful deployment of digital wallets  eliminates the need to own/carry physical  cards and enable decision support systems  to help customers optimise card usage  this drives a proliferation of niche and  merchant issued cards  splintering share  of wallet across many providers  customers with revolving balances elect to  use innovative point of sale vendor  financing schemes offering preferable  terms  credit card usage is eroded as  transactional card users migrate to payment  solutions that seamlessly link to their  bank accounts   the following scenarios illustrate potential outcomes generated by the innovations discussed in this topic  particularly in response to the key  question above – they are not meant to be future predictions  these scenarios are illustrations of particular aspects of the potential future and are not meant to represent a complete view of the market and  competitive landscape – in many cases  some or all scenarios could be realised at the same time payments: cashless world scenario 1: consolidation of the payment market (1 / 2) today future customers customers bank account bank account cards default  card payment  solutions payment  solutions merchants merchants narrative summary of impact to avoid “moments of truth” in customer decision-making  more  merchants and payment solutions will adopt an automated or one-click /  one-touch / one- tap check-out in both virtual and physical marketplaces.  these “seamless” check-out environments will rely on a default card that  will be used unless customers make a conscious choice to change cards.  as a result  default cards will become significantly stickier and receive a  higher share of total customer spend. card issuers will respond to the changing landscape by developing  products that provide the best loyalty points and benefits in aggregate to  compete for the role of the default card.  customers lose the desire to regularly use a variety of cards as  payment innovations enable a seamless transaction experience in one- click / one-touch or less   driven by simplicity and convenience  customers push more  transactions to a single default card  increasing the default card’s share  of wallet  as customers’ desire to switch cards decreases  traditional  differentiators like card brand and design may become less prominent   making it more difficult for card issuers to differentiate case studies order ahead in-app purchases within mobile apps can turn traditional physical  purchases into online purchases and combine purchase and  payment into a single tap  eliminating the step for payment method  selection virtual payment processing services store customers’ payment  credentials and allow customers to use those credentials in one-click  or tap to maximise convenience and improve security  payments: cashless world scenario 1: consolidation of the payment market (2 / 2) necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on…  availability and widespread adoption of seamless payment solutions to  a large number of customers and at a large proportion of everyday- spend merchants  customers’ willingness to relinquish control over payment options  (e.g.  convenience over control) customers merchants  less complex and time-consuming customer  experience at check-out  decreased cognitive effort on payment selection  reduced friction and improved efficiency at check- out  issuers seek to incentivize merchants to influence  consumers to load their cards incumbents  increased competitive intensity among existing  players to become top of wallet  marginalisation of niche players ecosystem  reduction in the number of credit card providers  increased stickiness to those surviving card issuing  institutions opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks  development of more personalised rewards program me for cards to  attract and retain customers  over time  potential decrease in the number of available card choices  as consumers use fewer cards  leading to decreased competition and  innovation payments: cashless world scenario 2: fragmentation of the payment market (1 / 2) today future customers customers bank account bank account cards cards payment  solutions payment  solutions merchants merchants narrative summary of impact the adoption of digital wallets will free consumers from physical limitations  on the number of cards they can carry  allowing niche cards to gain  popularity  particularly in geographies where customers are value- conscious.  this proliferation of cards will encourage the development of decision  support systems that interact with digital wallets to help customers choose  the best card for each purchase. as a result  owning and using multiple  payment cards will no longer hinder the delivery of a seamless customer  experience  prompting further proliferation of niche / merchant-issued  cards.  the successful deployment of digital wallets eliminates the need to  carry physical cards and virtually removes the limitations on the  number of payment cards customers can carry and use  proliferation of digital wallets also enables decision support systems to  help customers optimise card usage by automating card selection  based on loyalty points and other benefits  this drives a proliferation of niche and merchant-branded cards   optimised for specific purchases  splintering share of wallet across  many providers case studies currently  customers can add multiple payments cards (credit and  debit) to leading digital wallets (e.g.  8 for apple pay  unlimited for  google wallet)  and pick and choose a payment card for each  transaction with few additional clicks / taps while currently not integrated with digital wallets  decision support  systems run on mobile and wearable devices to automatically  recommend the optimal payment option among payment cards  added by the customers to maximise the overall rewards payments: cashless world scenario 2: fragmentation of the payment market (2 / 2) necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on…  merchants’ widespread acceptance of smart payment solutions or the  solutions’ successful integration with existing acceptance markets  development of payment solutions into platforms surrounded by  innovative ecosystems (e.g.  increased linkage between mobile wallets  and merchant apps  location-based check-out experience creation)  proven efficiency and impartiality of recommendations engines’ card  choice for each transactions  creation of streamlined user experience  and differentiated value propositions by smart wallets that will drive  consumers to want to adopt the optimisation services merchants incumbents customers  able to optimise reward collection without sacrificing  seamless experience  potential increase in debt as it becomes easier to  issue multiple credit cards  offset by spending  management functionalities of mobile wallets  potential decrease in total merchant service charges  paid as private-label cards are more widely adopted  among each merchant’s customer base  increased issuance of a greater variety of cards  increased competition from new entrants  including  merchant credit cards  stronger competitive position for niche players ecosystem  encourage issuers to improve and innovate their  product offerings (e.g.  rewards programmes  interest  rates) opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks  opportunities for merchants to directly enter the payments ecosystem  via private label solutions and gain deeper understanding of their  customers’ spending patterns  ability for financial institutions to introduce highly specialised rewards  programmes to capture specific segments of spend  decreasing opportunities to scale for credit card providers  potential decline in the efficacy of rewards programmes if card is only  used for most rewarding (lowest margin) transactions  displacement of traditional players who are not willing to participate in  smart payment solutions  potential arms race for rewards and backward optimisation payments: cashless world scenario 3: displacement of credit cards (1/3) today future customers customers bank account bank account cards payment  solutions payment  solutions merchants merchants narrative summary of impact today  merchants and payment solutions providers  such as mobile wallets  pay higher merchant service charges on credit card-funded transactions  than on bank account-funded transactions. to reduce costs  these players  will use incentives to encourage customers to switch their funding method  from credit cards to bank accounts. at the same time  merchants will adopt  data-driven alternative vendor financing solutions that offer customers  lower interest rates and provide financing income to merchants.  these innovations will place pressure on credit card transaction volume  and interest income; limiting issuers’ ability to offer attractive loyalty  programmes and reducing competitiveness in the face of merchants who  are able to directly offer their own incentives (e.g.  loyalty points  special  offers). case studies  credit card usage is eroded on two fronts: payment facilitation and  revolving lending / loyalty  payment solutions that link directly to bank accounts provide an  alternative to customers who previously relied on credit cards for  payment facilitation  point-of-sale vendor financing schemes and merchant loyalty  functionalities within new payment solutions further their appeal to  customers who currently rely on credit cards for revolving balances or  loyalty accumulation leading mobile payment solutions allow  customers to fund their purchases with credit  cards and bank accounts and generally earn  profits only on bank-funded transactions leading mobile payment platforms allow  customers to add  manage and use multiple  merchant loyalty programmes and enable  merchants to directly issue offers to customers emerging point-of-sale vendor financing  schemes provide revolving or purchase- specific line of credit to replace the need for  credit card financing payments: cashless world scenario 3: displacement of credit cards (2/3) necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on…  create incentives for customers to switch their funding methods customers ‒ merchants’ willingness to transfer financial incentives to customers  to be more appealing than the rewards offered by card issuers ‒ sufficient trust needs to build with wallet providers  alternative  lending providers and loyalty providers  development of alternative financing providers that can offer  comparable user experience and efficiency as credit cards (e.g.   seamless application process at pos and efficient loan servicing)   cooperation of bank account providers and payment solution providers  to allow a seamless connection of payment vehicle and account   including sufficient data visibility for real-time decisioning and  authorisation  clearly defined liability rules across all ecosystem participants and  payment solutions’ ability to provide zero liability for consumers while  offering higher rewards  bank account providers’ willingness to take on credit risk  fraud monitoring that maintains fraud levels near those of the current  payment networks  development of wallet solutions and business models that do not  impose large adoption costs to merchants and have a strong business  case  acceptance infrastructure of providers must be ubiquitous enough to  build customer use patterns  shift in financial incentives from card-driven rewards  programmes to direct savings from merchants  potential savings from lower transaction fees if bank  account / wallet providers can adopt security  innovations and offer protection at a lower

decentralised and non-traditional payment schemes executive summary context / innovation  the current value transfer system  built on automated clearing houses and intermediary banks  has made it easier for customers to send money  across geographies  but many pain points remain to enabling rapid and inexpensive value transfer between countries  decentralised currencies and mobile money solutions provide compelling alternatives to traditional value transferring systems by streamlining the  intermediating processes future of payment and settlement rails  driven by competitive pressure from these innovations  the future of value transfer will be more global  faster  more transparent  and cheaper ‒ these non-traditional schemes may compete directly with the existing financial ecosystem as alternative payment networks emerge along with a  variety of financial products denominated in network’s native currency ‒ financial institutions may choose to facilitate the growth of alternative payment networks as a complement to existing networks. they might act  as a gateway for value into these networks and launch financial products that are connected to non-traditional payment schemes ‒ alternatively  the non-traditional schemes may act as a catalyst for traditional institutions to develop solutions that fix key pain points in the  current value transfer system; potentially by leveraging elements of the non-traditional schemes key implications  to bring innovations to the traditional value transfer rails  financial institutions must collaborate to identify top priority areas for transformation solve  for regulatory complexity payments: decentralised and non-traditional payment schemes while the rails built on automated clearing houses have enabled value transfer  across geographies  many pain points are emerging as customer expectations rise how do financial institutions facilitate value transfer today?  while the current “rails” for value transfer between financial institutions are complex and involve many institutions a similar process is used for all  transactions; from large institutional transfers to the settlement of retail payments  1 sender request sender asks their financial  institution to transfer an amount to  a specific address (using bic or  iban codes) 2 secure messaging sending bank sends a secure  message to the recipient bank  requesting transfer of the specified  amount flow of funds the recipient bank responds to the  sender bank’s request for funds via  a clearing house or correspondent  bank flow of funds transfer request /  authorisation sender sender bank /  broker fx market intrabank interbank secure messaging automated  clearing house /  intermediary bank recipient bank recipient evolution of money transfer schemes key pain points with today’s schemes  the basic elements of the current value transfer process have been in  place for over 150 years  the concept of “wire transfers” was originated by telegraph companies  (e.g.  western union) who would receive funds for transfer from a  sending party and send a telegraph to correspondent branch instructing  them to deliver the money to the intended recipient  the digitisation of this process throughout the latter half of the 20th century improved the security of messaging services and improved the  settlement time of clearing house activities  the actual transfer is not instantaneous: funds may take several hours  or even days to move from the sender's account to the receiver's  account  if the sending and recipient banks do not hold reciprocal accounts the  payment must be sent to a clearing house or correspondent bank for  the assurance of payment for the recipient  adding costs and delays   the complex structure of requesting the recipient bank to demand  payment makes the process more vulnerable to fraud using exposed  sender credentials payments: decentralised and non-traditional payment schemes decentralised payment schemes leverage cryptographic protocols to transfer  value virtually in a secure  low cost  near-instantaneous manner what are decentralised payment schemes?  decentralised networks utilise a common set of protocols to allocate  tasks across many individual nodes rather than via a central point  email is an example of a decentralised system that uses a common  protocol (smtp) to distribute mail between a vast number of servers illustrative distributed payment network  decentralised payment systems allow users to transmit value between  users  typically secured by a set of cryptographic processes sender  most decentralised payment schemes use a single distributed ledger  and denominate payments between users in a native “currency ” often  referred to as a “crypto-currency”  recipient decentralised system / ledger how have decentralised schemes developed? what are some emerging decentralised schemes?  digital payment schemes are as old as the internet itself with many  notable failures including beenz  flooz  and digicash  and the most  notable success being paypal. however  all of these schemes utilised  a centralised network requiring trust by users in a central counterparty  in 2009 a pseudonymous whitepaper proposed the creation of a  distributed ledger where transactions between participants could be  processed in a trustless environment via a cryptographic process  the implementation of this distributed payment protocol is the bitcoin  network and the native currency of the ledger are bitcoins  since 2009 a range of service providers have emerged to support the  acceptance of payments via the bitcoin network  at the same time  many competing schemes have launched  built on  the

nonexistent payments: decentralised and non-traditional payment schemes mobile monies and p2p value transfer networks rely on a trusted central party to  transfer value rapidly across geographies  even in underbanked regions what are non-traditional payment schemes?  mobile money refers to a network that supports payment from one user  to another via a mobile device  a mobile money service may be launched by any firm  not just a  traditional financial institution. mobile money services have been  launched by network operators (mpesa) and online retailers (paypal)  transactions may be denominated in a fiat currency or in a form of  value issued by the central intermediary   in developing countries mobile payment solutions have been deployed  to extend financial services to the

share. in order to gain scale  m&a  activities among insurers will proliferate and insurers will partner with non- traditional companies  such as technology platforms  to distribute their  products. this will allow customers to compare prices and products more  readily and accelerate commoditisation of the market. insurers may also  actively reinsure their businesses using securitisation and alternative  capital sources to minimise regulatory burdens and stablise their margins.  with increasingly homogenised risk profiles and commoditised  personal insurance policies  the importance of scale to drive efficiency  will grow  leading to the market consolidation  disaggregation of distribution to technology platforms will enable  insurers to scale rapidly in a cost-effective manner  widened access to capital through securitisation and hedge funds will  generate excess underwriting capacity for insurers to support rapid  growth and consolidation case studies increased transparency via online channels and limited investment returns have put significant pressure on pricing in  the us auto insurance industry  driving a rapid consolidation over the past 10 years. even absent notable m&a  activities  large insurers who can afford big marketing and r&d budgets have grown rapidly; leveraging their  superior customer acquisition capabilities and a price advantage derived from economies of scale. as a result  the  share of top 10 auto insurers in the united states has grown from 59% in 2000 to 71% in 2012. insurance: disaggregation of value chain scenario 1: consolidation

resulting in increased  regulatory pressures insurance: disaggregation of value chain scenario 2: rise of multi-line policies (1 / 2) today: product-based insurance  future: customer-based insurance a b c d a customers a insurance company insurance contract  narrative summary of impact today insurers frequently cross sell commoditised  low margin products  with their higher margin peers (e.g.  the bundling of low margin auto  insurance with higher margin home insurance). as the commoditisation of  risks accelerates across various products  multi-line insurers may focus  more heavily on bundling and cross selling products to achieve economies  of scale and build customer loyalty.  leveraging the more granular and individualised data available through  connected devices  insurers may ultimately be able to take product cross  selling to its logical extreme; offering a single insurance policy covering all  (or a very wide range) of an individual’s risks.  personal insurance products that are commoditised in the future will be  increasingly used as a bundle to cross sell other more profitable  products  as the concept of property ownership blurs in the sharing economy  the  concept of cross sell may expand so that an insurance policy  encompasses all risks associated with the customer  rather than risks  associated with specific assets  through increased connectivity  the “personal” insurance policies may  be adjusted more frequently to add  subtract or modify coverages to  match the customers’ individual usage patterns case studies farm family has introduced the concept  of aggregate flexible contract to small / medium enterprises   concentrating on  rural and suburban area  and targeting specific risks surrounding certain sectors (e.g.  special farm package 10 for  agriculture owners). on the personal insurance side  many multi-line insurers offer bundling discounts to customers to  promote cross sell across personal auto  home and life policies  with auto and home cross sell being more popular among  customers  yet multi-line contracts are still not widely adopted. insurance: disaggregation of value chain scenario 2: rise of multi-line policies (2 / 2) necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on…  insurance companies need to be able to assess and cover a wide  range of risks for individuals

(e.g.  manhattan). multi-line insurers who sell both personal and  commercial policies today may also choose to exit the commoditised  personal insurance market and focus more heavily on the commercial  market  where their specialised capabilities can lead to higher margins  and growth / customer retention. case studies personal sme large commercial niche / specialty  summary of impact  disaggregation of the personal lines value chain may lead some  insurers to shift their focus to niche markets where traditional  capabilities (e.g.  actuary and underwriting) can make bigger  differences in performance and profitability  or pivot toward an  increased focus on commercial lines   in these markets  distribution and underwriting will continue to be  relatively more manual and the insurers’ expertise will not be easily  replicated or replaced bought by many  a uk-based insurance start-up  brings together customers with specific insurance needs  (e.g.  age  illness

relationship further disaggregated and personal lines products further  commoditised  customers will become more fickle and creating customer loyalty will become increasingly difficult  self-insurance models: the overall revenue for the insurance industry will be reduced as the agents of the commoditising forces (e.g.  self-driving  car manufacturers  sharing economy platforms) gain scale and begin to self-insure  competitive benchmarking: insurers’ ability to scan and benchmark against competitors’ pricing models and strategies will become more  important as customers gain visibility into prices from multiple insurers via digital distribution platforms  how will insurers create customer loyalty and stickiness going forward as the insurance products become increasingly

potentially via human  workforce  will become more important  again to penetrate niche and commercial  markets implications ? remaining questions insurance how will an ever more connected  world impact the value delivered by  insurance providers? insurance: increasing levels of connectivity executive summary context / innovation  increasing adoption of connected devices in cars  homes and lifestyles presents an opportunity for insurers to expand the use of telematics  i.e.  the  integration of telecommunication and information processing future of personal insurance  expansion of the telematics insurance models through connected devices and platforms will create channels for insurers to better understand their  customers and engage more closely with them ‒ connected devices can allow insurers to track and continuously refine individual risk profiles  enabling more accurate underwriting of individual  risks and more personalised products ‒ insurers can also evolve into a risk manager for clients by interacting more frequently with their customers and proactively participating in risk  management through their customers’ connected devices ‒ furthermore  insurers could leverage the individualised data gathered through connected devices to gain a fuller view of customers’ identities  and lifestyles  and work with retailers and external parties to deliver relevant  and financially beneficial  offers to customers  key implications  to reap the benefits of new business models enabled by connected devices  insurers must work closely with device and service providers and must  also define acceptable boundaries in utilising customer data insurance: increasing levels of connectivity the business model for property & casualty (p&c) and health insurance has  been refined over the centuries  but improvement opportunities still exist  traditionally  p&c and health insurance policies have been priced based on predictions made using historical information and best in class  statistical models traditional p&c and health insurance processes exploration &  submission 3rd party data underwriting  (quoting) binding claims servicing renewal  risks are priced based on the data customers submitted and some 3rd party data  including historical data and predictive indicators  against  loss models and clusters created by insurers based on historical statistics  after binding  insurers and customers do not interact until renewal unless specific events are triggered such as claims (e.g.  accidents) or  servicing (e.g.  address change)  customers’ usage and losses are reflected in their risk profile only in the underwriting process during the next renewal cycle improvement opportunities in the traditional p&c and health insurance model backward-looking limited interactions passive despite the gradual improvement on the  accuracy of loss prediction models  losses are  predicted using historical indicators. most pricing  models do not adjust to real-time individual  behavioural and usage data.  profitable  claim-free customers typically do not  interact with insurers until renewal  limiting  insurers’ ability to demonstrate value to them  and develop stickiness insurers only react to customers’ predicted risk  profiles upon binding and at renewal  with little to  no visibility into proactive risk management  opportunities throughout the policy term insurance: increasing levels of connectivity telematics offers a promising proposition to p&c and health insurers and  customers  but its adoption is slow due to a number of factors what is telematics?  first introduced in the mid-2000s  telematics insurance products leverage the gps technology and wireless communications to enable auto insurers  to collect usage and behaviour data of their customers in real time or near-real time  leveraging such data  insurers charge customers’ premiums based on their usage of the vehicles and current driving behaviours instead of typical  fixed premiums  given the strong correlation between usage of vehicles and risks  today’s telematics devices have evolved to measure a variety of additional behavioural factors from rapid acceleration to air bag deployment exploration &  submission 3rd party data underwriting  (quoting) binding claims servicing (near) real-time  behaviour-based pricing renewal benefits of telematics factors inhibiting adoption of telematics  pricing accuracy: insurers’ risk models become more accurate as  individual  empirical and near real-time data is used combined with  historical predictions based on segmentation  lower claims: telematics products incentivise safer behaviours  among customers as premiums are linked directly to the behaviours  and reduce the overall claims losses for insurers   personalisation: as usage and behavioural data accumulates  the  insurance premium becomes increasingly personalised to each  customer  resulting in lower premiums for customers and customer  stickiness for insurers device selection  installation of physical tracking devices creates an  additional “moment of truth” when customers may  abandon adoption of telematics   only predominantly low-risk customers sign up for  telematics-based insurance contracts and high-risk  customers opt out  deterring insurers’ economics delays  gathering and utilisation of data is usually delayed  due to connectivity  costs and analytical power incentives  discounts often do not serve as sufficient incentives  for customers to adopt and share personal data insurance: increasing levels

alternative models of lending executive summary context / innovation  following the financial crisis  lower risk appetites among retail banks have significantly limited access to traditional bank intermediated lending. this  is particularly true among sub-prime borrowers  over the same period of time alternative lending platforms leveraging p2p models have experienced rapid growth. these platforms use alternative  adjudication methods and lean  automated processes to offer loans to a broader base of customers and a new class of investment opportunities to  savers  future of savings & lending  as competitive pressures from alternative lending platforms grow  the overall savings and lending industry will be forced to compete ‒ alternative lenders could successfully move upstream to replace traditional institutions in intermediating prime loans while traditional lenders   restricted by legacy processes and high capital requirements  lose share  ‒ alternatively  traditional institutions and alternative platforms may continue to cater to different classes of investors and borrowers  especially  with growing partnerships between smaller traditional institutions and alternative platforms  ‒ traditional institutions could also transform their processes and technologies  potentially absorbing alternative platforms  to adopt the key  features of alternative lending business models key implications  emerging alternative lending models create both competitive threats and evolutionary opportunities for financial institutions  making it important for  incumbent institutions and alternative platforms to develop more integrated partnerships and learn from and share each other’s capabilities deposits & lending: alternative models of lending in a risk-averse economy  retail banks’ model of intermediating savers and  borrowers has reduced accessibility to loans for subprime customers how do financial institutions facilitate lending activities today?  retail banks receive savings from their account holders and provide interest on the  savings in return. in most countries  regulators mandate banks to insure and hold  minimum reserve on the savings held  using the saved funds  retail banks originate loans to borrowers and receive interest  in return. the availability of loans and the interest rates are determined by the  adjudication of borrowers’ risk profiles  typically using credit scores risk- averse  typically  interest received on loans are higher than interest paid on savings to  account for default risks and other operational costs  the breadth of borrowers served is dependent on each bank’s risk appetite  which is  generally related to the size and scale of the banks (e.g.  riskier borrowers tend to  be served by tier 2/3 banks or balance sheet lenders) risk- seeking savers borrowers retail  banks not served by  traditional  retail banks low- risk high- risk evolution of traditional lending models  following the 2008-2009 global financial crisis  customer trust  surrounding financial services quickly dissipated  regulators also mandated increased safety measures around loans  (e.g.  higher capital requirements) which resulted in many banks  tightening loan requirements   this mutual loss of confidence created a lending gap  leaving a  considerable portion of borrowing needs underserved by financial  institutions  furthermore  customer preferences in financial services are rapidly  changing  demanding more transparency  efficiency and control over  their savings and loans key characteristics of traditional models limited access slow speed a growing lending gap limits  the availability of loans to  individuals and companies with  higher risk profiles traditional

by acting as online marketplaces p2p lenders  facing lower funding costs than traditional  depository lenders alternative adjudication  alternative lending platforms assess the  creditworthiness of borrowers based on  metrics beyond the credit scores used by  traditional lenders (e.g.  social data)  lean  automated processes  alternative lending platforms are free of  legacy processes and technologies  allowing  them to onboard and assess borrowers and  lenders in a more streamlined fashion  most alternative lenders also refine their risk  engine more frequently than traditional  lenders to incorporate feedback based on  empirical analysis  at most alternative platforms  assessment of  borrowers is at least partly automated against  predefined rules for fast  transparent  processing deposits & lending: alternative models of lending traditional and alternative lending models differ significantly in their flexibility and  allocation of risk   traditional lending intermediaries (e.g.  retail banks) take risks themselves and leverage their scale to provide stability to lenders (depositors)   however their focus is typically limited to low-risk borrowers and they charge high fees (in form of interest spread). therefore the needs of risk-seeking  savers and high-risk borrowers are not fully served by traditional banks  alternative lending platforms

sufficient  customer trust and reputation to attract more risk-adverse investors and  low-risk borrowers. the ability of alternative lending platforms to offer  borrowers lower interest rates and a more streamlined customer  experience will also help attract and retain low-risk borrowers. as lending marketplaces move upstream to prime lending markets they  may evolve to become the primary origination point for consumer lending  and an investment destination for a portion of bank’s deposit float.  leveraging alternative adjudication methods  streamlined processes   and lower overhead  alternative lenders successfully move upstream  and emerge as a cheaper and faster direct competitor to traditional  lending institutions in the low-risk lending space  entrenched by legacy processes / technologies and capital  requirements  traditional institutions do not adapt quickly enough and  lose share to leaner and more consumer-friendly alternative lending  platforms case studies launched in 2005 as the world’s first p2p lending service   zopa targets only prime lenders as determined by its  adjudication model  and competes with traditional institutions  on rates / returns and a more seamless originations process.  in 2014  zopa achieved a default rate of 0.38 percent   significantly lower than traditional institutions. launched in 2006  creditease started as a chinese p2p

risk-averse risk-seeking traditional institutions alternative  platforms borrowers low-risk high-risk narrative summary of impact unable to build sufficient customer awareness / trust  particularly in the  market for low-risk lending  alternative lenders enter into partnerships with  existing financial institutions. traditional financial institutions are able to  refer high-risk borrowers who do not meet minimum lending requirements  to alternative platforms  thereby helping those customers fulfill their  financing needs without the risk of losing other elements of their business  (e.g.  deposit accounts  credit cards) to another traditional financial  institution. some smaller  and more regional  institutions may also find it beneficial to  “park” excess funds with their lending marketplace partners as a  mechanism for diversifying their lending portfolios.  traditional institutions and alternative lending platforms continue to  cater to different classes of investors and borrowers – traditional  institutions cater to the low-risk market based on trust  and alternative  platforms cater to the high-risk market based on access  some traditional institutions with limited lending bandwidth may partner  with alternative lenders to meet the underserved needs of their  customer base  by referring customers or investing excess capital  overall  more customers gain access to savings and lending products  that best suit their needs as the industry becomes more diversified case studies in 2014  lending club (an alternative lending platform) and union bank (a u.s. regional bank) formed a strategic  alliance. under the agreement  union bank plans to purchase personal loans through the lending club’s platform and  work with the platform on the co-creation of new

funding platforms executive summary context / innovation  traditionally  capital raising activities have been facilitated by specialised financial institutions  leveraging their deep expertise to identify and  support investment opportunities. access to investments in these intermediaries has been limited to select high net worth and institutional investors  in the face of growing interest in start-ups and digital democratisation  a series of alternative funding platforms have emerged  widening access to  capital raising activities and providing funding to a greater number of companies and projects future of alternative funding platforms   while these alternative funding platforms are not likely to replace the traditional capital raising ecosystem in the short or medium term  their growth  could change the role of incumbent institutions ‒ alternative funding platforms may solidify their position as a key capital raising intermediary for higher risk seed-stage companies  which would  increase their access to funding and increase the number of new firms eligible for venture capital ‒ alternative platforms could also evolve to focus on investors with motives beyond financial return. they could help funnel capital to low-return  opportunities that would not have qualified for investment from traditional venture capitalists but provide non-financial returns to crowd investors  (e.g.  alternative energy projects or local development projects)  ‒ alternative capital raising platforms could also provide a channel for larger companies to raise capital directly from their customers base   potentially reducing costs while supporting customer engagement key implications  the opportunities created by the proliferation of alternative capital raising platforms likely outweigh the risks they pose to incumbent institutions as  they enable a more diversified pipeline of investment opportunities to support a richer innovation ecosystem capital raising: alternative funding platforms capital raising has been traditionally facilitated by specialised institutions with  deep expertise  but individual investors have limited access so far how do financial institutions facilitate capital raising activities today?  while smaller loans for small / medium enterprises are directly issued by retail /  commercial banks  larger capital needs of companies are typically fulfilled by issuing  equity or debt through a specialised intermediary like an investment bank  unlike lending transactions where loans are issued from the banks’ balance sheet   investment banks facilitate the structuring  marketing and sales of equity or debt  capital to potential investors and charge a fee to the issuing company (in certain  cases  banks participate as an investor by buying shares / bonds  managing  investors funds or providing a lending facility)  issuing companies directly pay back principal and interest on debt or pay dividends  for equity to the investors  layers

providing  capital to investment opportunities description of alternative funding platforms  alternative funding platforms provide an opportunity for businesses to interact  directly with individual investors to widen options for raising capital  instead of providing investment advice or directly marketing investments in equity  or debt capital  alternative funding platforms aggregate investment opportunities   provide a standardised view of the opportunities and facilitate legal structuring of  equity or debt issued  the rating of investment opportunities are conducted through the wisdom of the  crowd (i.e.  minimum target must be met for successful funding) or by allowing  more experienced individual investors to lead the investment activities  instead of  using credit rating agencies or sell-side analysts investors mass high net worth institutional facilitator alternative funding platforms investment opportunities local seed series  a-d mid- market large key characteristics of

investment  opportunities  investment opportunities are typically only  funded when a pre-determined target is met   to weed out less credible or less promising  opportunities through “crowd’s approval”  some alternative funding platforms leverage  the expertise of more experienced individual  investors in certain fields (e.g.  angel  investors) by providing them an opportunity to  lead funding for desired investments  alternative funding platforms provide a  number of customisable parameters for  businesses to adjust and easily design  funding options desirable for them  (e.g.  term  equity share)  some platforms allow these “lead” investors  to gain additional income through fees  similar  to carries paid to general partners of private  equity firms   moreover  some

summary of impact the popularity of peer-based funding platforms grows but remains focused  on seed-stage ventures  with later stage firms opting to raise funds  through traditional providers  such as venture capitalists  who are able to  provide guidance and access to networks. within this environment early-stage companies can more easily test their  product ideas  and gain exposure to potential

potential deals.  peer-based funding platforms solidify their position as the capital  raising intermediaries for higher risk seed-stage companies  private equity and venture capital firms move

mid-market large narrative summary of impact peer-based capital raising platforms that focus on seed-stage investment  opportunities lose popularity among mass investors as they realise that  the investment horizon is very long and the chance of a successful exit is  extremely low. instead  peer-based platforms shift their focus to smaller projects that  either have a higher chance of generating sustainable profits sooner  or  can deliver benefits above and beyond financial return. examples of non- financial returns include community development (e.g.  funding expansion  of a favorite coffee shop  funding re-paving local roads) and ideological  pursuits (e.g.  sustainable energy).  peer-based funding platforms focus on connecting lower-return  investment opportunities  which would not qualify for capital raising  through traditional intermediaries  with investors with motives beyond  financial return (e.g.  empowering local community  sustainability)  seed-stage companies continue to be funded by traditional venture  capitalists and angel investors who can provide appropriate guidance  for growth  peer-based mechanisms are adopted by traditional

context / innovation  many processes within investment institutions are considered as “core” to their business operation. however  a new breed of process  externalisation providers are using highly flexible platforms (typically based in the cloud) to provide financial institutions with increased efficiency  and new levels of process sophistication / excellence future of process externalisation   as service providers externalise and consolidate processes previously considered core capabilities  the core competencies that differentiate winning  financial institutions shift from process execution to more “human” factors (e.g.  synthesis  decision making)  external service providers could enable small and medium-sized organisations to better compete with large incumbents by providing them access  to top-tier processes that were once unreachable due to lack of scale   some external providers that consolidate regulatory compliance capabilities may also create an opportunity to centralise communications to  regulatory agencies. this would improve the speed at which financial institutions are able to respond to regulatory changes and ensure a higher  level of compliance key implications  by exploring options to externalise a large number of redundant processes across institutions  firms will benefit from efficiency gains and increased  sophistication  however  financial institutions must consider which capabilities they should continue to focus on as a source of competitive advantage investment management: process externalisation many processes within investment management institutions considered as core  to their business today are facing various pressures core capabilities of investment institutions today  over the past few decades  externalisation of non-core processes (e.g.  hr  finance) has been a major trend in the financial services industry to drive  efficiency and operational excellence  despite this trend many processes  such as transaction monitoring  regulatory compliance and risk management continue to be perceived as mission  critical or competitive differentiators and have remained in house data  collection analysis trade strategy  & execution transaction  monitoring risk  management compliance hr finance “core” processes largely remaining in-house  “none-core” processes  typically externalised evolution of landscape impacting core processes key challenges faced by institutions  the notion of core internal processes can change when external  providers emerge with the ability to complete the process more  efficiently and with more sophistication than individual institutions ‒ the ability to access and collect market data was once considered  a critical internal competency for equity investments firms until  external providers emerged to provide more standardised and  comprehensive set of data (e.g.  bloomberg  thomson reuters)  a number of issues are arising that impact the institutions’ ability to  excel across today’s core processes: ‒ increased regulatory burden as a result of the 2008 financial crisis  (e.g.  the dodd-frank act) and the introduction of stricter  compliance requirements (e.g.  anti-money laundering) has taken up  a large amount of institutions’ capacity ‒ legacy processes and systems built based on the physical  computing environment continue to limit institutions’ flexibility and  agility in adapting to the rapidly changing market conditions and  continuously evolving regulatory requirements capacity constraints lost capacity on updates and  maintenance limits the ability to  invest in core capabilities high cost of maintenance updating and maintaining  processes and technologies are  costly and time-consuming limited flexibility / agility inconsistency timely update of the processes  and technologies is limited due to  costs and efforts required fragmented  local legacy  processes and technologies  impede connectivity across the  organisation scale-driven barriers complexity sophistication of capabilities is  not feasible due to the institutions’  scale and size inflexible systems designed for  past market environments result  in added complexity to adapt to  the current environment  investment management: process externalisation the new breed of process externalisation providers are built on the technologies  and

institution b narrative summary of impact financial institutions begin to outsource select processes to specialised  external firms who leverage advanced technologies to provide improved  outcomes at a much lower cost. efforts previously spent on managing  these processes in-house can be deployed toward higher value activities  that provide competitive differentiation.  as this pattern repeats over multiple processes  a financial institution’s  competitive position ceases to be defined by core operational excellence  and instead is defined by which higher value activities they have chosen to  focus on.  service providers using advanced technologies provide options for  financial institutions to externalise processes once considered core  capabilities   competitive advantages derived from excellence in process execution  will disappear as high quality process execution becomes a commodity  available for purchase  financial institutions are required to redefine what capabilities  differentiate them from other institutions with process execution taking  a backseat to more “human” factors case studies the ability to quickly and accurately model market projections and hypotheses through large quant teams has  traditionally been a key advantage of large financial institutions. kensho threatens that advantage by offering a next- generation analytics platform for the investment industry with massively-parallel statistical computing  scalable analytics  architectures and user-friendly visual interfaces. by leveraging kensho’s platform  any investment institution can now  rapidly model projections without an army of quantitative analysts; instead focusing more “human” capabilities like  hypothesis generation and market insights. investment management: process externalisation scenario 1: redefined core capabilities of financial institutions (2 / 2) necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on…  external service provider’s ability to demonstrate a clear business case  for financial institutions to outsource many core functions customers  high quality service levels across most financial  institutions  clear definition of accountabilities and liabilities between financial  institutions and their service providers  securing regulatory comfort by demonstrating financial institutions’  control over the externalised processes incumbents  access to increasingly differentiated services /  product offerings among financial institutions  need to reallocate resources to develop new core  capabilities  increased pressure to identify and develop new  differentiating capabilities ecosystem  emergence of a class of institutions specialising in  externalising specific processes  increase in the average level of sophistication of  processes across institutions opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks  fewer process failures as they are externalised to more focused and  specialised providers  emergence of institutions competing to excel in specific processes  drives deeper specialisation  increased capacity for financial institutions to be innovative due to  reduced focus on resource intensive core processes  centralisation of processes creates larger implications of process  failures including continuity risks for banking in the case of a failure of  an external service provider  risks resulting from potential lack of clarity surrounding accountabilities  loss of deep process knowledge within financial institutions may have  unforeseen spill-over consequences in other areas of the business investment management: process externalisation scenario 2: level playing field for newer  smaller financial institutions (1 / 2) today future large institutions have  access to sophisticated  processes small institutions have  limited ability to build  sophisticated processes both small and large institutions gain access to  sophisticated processes via focused external providers vs. narrative once an external service provider has developed the tools for a financial  institution to externalise a process  the cost of extending that service to  additional financial institutions is typically very low and not dependent on  the institution’s size. small and medium-sized financial institutions capitalise on these  economics to both improve their efficiency and radically increase the  sophistication of their processes across the board. as process  sophistication ceases to be a source of competitive advantage for large  financial institutions  small and medium-sized institutions are able to  increase their focus on differentiating capabilities. summary of impact  external service providers provide small and medium-sized  organisations access to sophisticated capabilities  which were  previously unattainable due to lack of scale  barriers to entry into the market will be lowered and the playing field  will be leveled with small and medium-sized organisations increasingly  able to compete with large institutions case studies open gamma uses and an open source platform to provide real-time market risk management analytics to buy-side  sell-side  and clearing institutions. while open gamma provides the platform free of charge  they offer support  consulting and training services to help institutions configure and modify the platform and select appropriate risk models. the platform includes a  number of advanced functions not normally available to small institutions.  through services like open gamma  new and small institutions no longer need to set up extensive support functions in middle  and back offices to attain sophisticated capabilities and compete with larger institutions. investment management: process externalisation scenario 2: level playing field for newer  smaller financial institutions (2 / 2) necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on…  externalisation providers must be able to provide suitable options for  both small and large institutions customers  wider universe of options for financial services as  customers’ choice of institutions is no longer restricted  by their scale  clear definition of accountabilities and liabilities of financial institutions  and their service providers  securing regulatory comfort by demonstrating financial institutions’  control the externalised processes incumbents  increased competition as smaller institutions gain a  stronger competitive position  a need to re-evaluate business models that are based  on economies of scale ecosystem  wider distribution of market share  increased monitoring burden to regulators as the  number of players increase opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks  potential increase in diversification of strategies as smaller financial  institutions are empowered to pursue innovative strategies  increased competition might lead to reduction of transaction costs for  customers  risks to small and mid-sized players that their externalisation service  providers will be acquired and internalised by large financial institutions  systemic benefits of scale  such as visibility into the market  may erode  as the average size of institutions decreases investment management: process externalisation scenario 3: centralised communications with regulatory agencies (1 / 2) today future risk   monitor &  compliance risk   monitor &  compliance narrative summary of impact a number of niche service providers are emerging who are able to  externalise processes related to specific regulations (e.g.  restricted  holdings  kyc). these firms are able to interpret regulatory changes and  translate them into rules that can be applied across various financial  institutions  improving regulatory compliance and the speed at which  financial institutions can respond to regulatory changes. as regulatory compliance within financial institutions becomes more  closely integrated with these service providers  some regulators may  choose to collaborate directly with them even to the point of issuing  regulations in code rather than as policy documents.  more regulatory compliance and monitoring processes are outsourced  to a small number of service providers with better connections to and  understanding of regulations  reducing the compliance burden for  financial institutions  these compliance service providers can act as centralised  communication touch point for regulators  by solidifying their connections with regulators  these providers  improve the speed at which financial institutions are able to respond to  regulatory changes  ensuring a higher level of compliance case studies fundapps organises regulatory information and delivers a cloud-based managed-service to automate shareholding  disclosure and monitor investment restrictions across 100+ regulatory regimes on a daily basis. fundapps partners with  a global legal service provider to monitor and translate changes in relevant regulations into rules on a daily basis. if regulatory agencies partner with fundapps in the future  they could ensure consistent compliance across financial  institutions  make dissemination of regulatory changes in disclosure regimes faster  and reduce the compliance burden  faced by the industry. investment management: process externalisation scenario 3: centralised communications with regulatory agencies (2 / 2) necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on…  buy-in from multiple regulators to collaborate with external service  providers regarding regulatory topics will be necessary. dealing with  emerging risks like cyber security might be a good starting point  solid track record of performance and reliability demonstrated by  externalisation business models   full accountability and liability for actions remain with financial  institutions customers incumbents  increased trust in financial institutions as overall  compliance level increases  ability to respond faster  more easily and more  cheaply to regulatory shifts  freed capacity from compliance processes to focus  on the core competencies  critical mass of financial institutions externalise regulatory processes to  a manageable number of service providers  ecosystem  higher  more consistent level of regulatory  compliance  formalisation of externalisation providers as a core  piece of the overall financial ecosystem  higher level of clarity in regulations opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks  opportunities to improve the clarity of regulations across jurisdictions  cost for compliance and regulation  which tends to be very high in  global institutions  potentially will be reduced  standardised data simplifies supervision for regulators  unclear how risks of regulatory capture will be influenced by  externalised compliance models  amplification of non-compliant activities and unclear liabilities when  centralised externalisation providers fail  decreased internal compliance expertise within financial institutions  may have unintended consequences investment management: process externalisation what does this mean for financial institutions? key implications and remaining questions “safe bets” – likely implications under all scenarios  loss of negotiating power and continuity: as more capabilities  technologies and processes are externalised financial institutions will become  increasingly dependent on 3rd parties for continuity  skill loss of workforce: even though externalising less valuable capabilities will create efficiency  it may result in workforce skill loss over the long term and employees ability to develop a holistic view of financial services operations  how will financial institutions participate in capability sharing with other institutions to balance efficiency with control (e.g.  utility creation  co- ? development  3rd party providers)?  how will financial institutions prevent the loss of negotiating power and continuity as the next generation

market provisioning: smarter  faster machines as the popularity and profitability of high frequency trading declines  the next  evolution of algorithmic  machine trading remains in question overview of algorithmic trading and high frequency trading  the use of algorithms in trading activities has proliferated in lockstep with the evolution of computing power since its initial application for optimal  portfolio determination in the 1970s and the emergence of fully automated algorithmic trades in the early 1990s  since then  the key focus of algorithmic trading has been on exploiting arbitrage opportunities in time and / or across venues by leveraging low  latency access to the exchanges (i.e.  high-frequency trading  autonomous market makers) and thereby providing liquidity to the market  these high frequency traders largely replaced the market-making activities traditionally performed by broker dealers  who provided liquidity and  made prices by manually coordinating offers and taking on the risks of buying and selling shares in return for spread  while some trading firms and hedge funds use algorithms to achieve faster processing times for analysis of large datasets; price discovery and  order execution remain the most active areas of high frequency trading data collection data processing  and analytics trading strategy  formation price discovery order

summary of impact as the benefits that can be earned from incremental investments in high  frequency trading decrease  algorithmic traders will shift their focus to  real-life events by connecting to new data sources available from social  media feeds to machine readable news. (1) due to the vast amount of  data available  most algorithmic traders will focus on different events and  triggers. (2) unlike most high frequency trading strategies  the market  reaction to real-life events is not certain and traders with different views   skills and analytical tools will make different decisions in face of the same  data. as the result  the trading strategies and tactics of algorithmic traders  will vastly diversify.  the focus of a race for speed moves from chasing price movements to  responding to real-life events through big data analysis and machine  accessible news  market makers’ trading strategies become diversified as they access  different data sources and infer different market outcomes  diversification leads to increase in intraday volatility and wider ask-bid  spread case studies new innovative services like dataminr and sntmnt enable traders to gain access to events and news that  may trigger market movement (e.g.  breaking news  m&a speculation) faster than the competition by utilising  non-traditional data sources like social media / market sentiment and real-time analytics. leveraging these platforms  algorithmic traders can leverage their infrastructure to shift focus from reacting to  stock price movements to monitoring and reacting to real-life events faster than other traders and investors in  the market. market provisioning: smarter faster machines scenario 2: convergence of trading strategies and activities data  sources self- learning  machines market analyses various data and  predicts market outlook in  similar ways takes a similar action on  any stock narrative summary of impact as access to a universe of real-time data feeds becomes essential to the  execution of successful algorithmic trading strategies  the set of data used  by traders converges with every trader using almost every available data  source. at the same time algorithms become smarter incorporating  machine learning and improving the accuracy of projections. with algorithmic traders connected to similar data sources and smarter  machines generating similar projections from those data  the variances  among algorithmic traders’ activities will decrease.   accuracy of market projections by trading algorithms gradually  improves as market makers gain access to broader sets of big data  and more sophisticated machines  since each market maker’s system accurately predicts the market  movement  differences among various market makers’ projections and  trading strategies are eliminated  as trading strategies converge  volume decreases and arbitrage  opportunities effectively disappear case studies ayasdi leverages topological data analysis to process big data sets to unveil patterns within the network of data. in capital markets  ayasdi’s technology can be used to understand the relationships between various real-life events and market  performance to derive trading hypotheses. over time  additional historical data and trading outcomes can be added back to the analysed big data to continuously sophisticate and automatically correct the trading hypotheses.  neuro dimension’s tradingsolutions combines technical analysis with artificial intelligence using neural networks and genetic  algorithms to learn patterns from historical data and optimise system parameters. as these types of systems become more sophisticated  algorithmic traders will simultaneously predict the market performance  with a greater degree of accuracy and their trading activities will converge. market provisioning: smarter faster machines scenario 3: reverting to manual processes data  sources traders market regulations require access to external data and /  or trade execution to be intervened manually narrative summary of impact the utilisation of new data sources like machine readable news and  advanced computing in trading activities increases the gap in the level of  sophistication between professional algorithmic traders and individual   retail investors. the public may perceive some of these innovations to be  an “unfair” advantage; similar to how infrastructures costs associated with  high frequency trading have been scrutinised.  reacting to public sentiment  policy makers and regulatory agencies may  impose restrictions on what automated data streams and trading  machines can and cannot be used for various activities. potential  misinterpretation of data by smart machines triggering systemic losses  might accelerate such movements toward regulation.  growing public discontent with algorithmic trading leads to regulations  on the use of automated data feeds and / or smart machines in  obtaining information or executing trades   at least some parts of market-making activities revert to old  manual  processes  tangibly reducing the trade volume and the liquidity of the  market  as a result  the liquidity of the market will decrease. as traders cannot  react to fact-based price arbitrage as quickly  they may also increase  their spread to mitigate their risks  resulting in unfavourable price  formation for both buyers and sellers case studies on 23 april 2013  a false report of explosions at the white house was posted on the hacked twitter account of associated  press. with many algorithmic traders’ systems linked to key twitter feeds  algorithmic trades caused a selling spree nearly  immediately after the posting. as the result  $136 billion was wiped out from the s&p 500 index within two minutes of the  tweet’s posting. while the market quickly recovered three minutes after the correcting announcement  many industry  experts and regulatory agencies perceive the event as something that would not have been caused by human traders as  humans would have second-guessed the validity of the tweet. market provisioning: smarter faster machines what does this mean for financial institutions? key implications and remaining questions “safe bets” – likely implications under all scenarios  reduced role of humans: as the adoption of smarter and faster machines accelerates the competition for speed in gathering  analysing and acting  on data  the role of humans in trade execution will diminish and intelligent machines will replace largely human activities today  such as trading  strategy development  larger impact of errors: even small errors in data integrity  trade strategy  and trade execution will lead to much larger impact as end-to-end  trading activities are automated via smarter  faster machines  with limited human intervention  what role will human traders play as end-to-end trading activities become automated through smarter  faster machines? ?  how will financial institutions effectively sort out erroneous data  algorithms and execution to avoid resulting in enormous losses  while maintaining  ? execution speed? scenario 1: diversification of trading  strategies and tactics scenario 2: convergence of trading strategies  and activities scenario 3: reverting to manual processes  competition for data sources: competition to discover new data sources  and gain exclusivity will intensify as the  focus of algorithmic trading shifts from price  movements to real-life events  increased specialisation: traders with a  deeper understanding of specific  companies  sectors and real-life events will  gain advantage over firms with broader  approaches as trading strategies diversify  how will financial institutions gain exclusive  ? or faster access to data without appearing  as having an unfair advantage?  marginalised returns: as trading strategies  converge through big data and machine  learning  competition for each trade  triggered by real-life events will intensify  and marginal returns will diminish  competition for speed: when most  players in the market rely on similar trading  strategies  the basis for competition will shift  again from discovery of new insights to  faster execution via infrastructure  investments  how will each institution differentiate from  ? one another as the convergence of trading  strategies via smarter  faster machines  lower the margin?  competitive uncertainty: capabilities  required to be competitive in the market  (e.g.  faster computation  faster access   advanced analytics) will change drastically  and rapidly depending on regulatory  changes  leading to uncertainty in traders’  long-term strategies  impetus for agility: in order to react timely  to those competitive uncertainties generated  by potential regulations  traders’  organisational agility will become critical  amidst the current shift toward replacement  of workforce with smarter  faster machines  implications ? remaining questions market provisioning what impact will better connected  buyers and sellers have on capital  markets? market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers executive summary context / innovation  many illiquid financial assets remain highly dependent on intermediating institutions to discover and connect buyers and sellers  often based on  networks of pre-existing relationships with other institutions   however  following the financial crisis  traditional capital market intermediaries’ risk appetite has been reduced while their capital requirements  increased  limiting their ability to take positions on financial assets to create liquidity; this has resulted in reduced liquidity mainly for non exchange  traded assets  leveraging automation and standardisation of information flow  a number of platforms (information/connection platforms) have emerged with an aim  to redefine how buyers and sellers are connected in a variety of markets future of market making / intermediation  as these platforms proliferate  the market landscape may change for many financial products and assets ‒ new information/connection platforms will allow demand and supply represented by smaller intermediaries to be more readily and objectively  discovered by counterparties  levelling the playing field between them and larger institutions ‒ alternatively  these platforms could be developed for a “group” of larger institutions to improve connectivity among themselves  reducing their  need to connect with smaller intermediaries and stabilising the current market framework for existing institutions ‒ information/connection platforms may also choose to extend the connections to individual investors  acting as a market for specific assets and  products and opening doors for sellers to easily broaden their buyer base to the broader public key implications  improving information flow among market participants through new information/connection platforms will create tangible benefits to the industry by  empowering intermediating institutions to optimise their ability to make the best decisions for their clients; however  it will also require behaviour  changes within those institutions market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers over-the-counter activities depend on intermediating institutions to discover and  connect buyers and sellers how do financial institutions facilitate financial markets liquidity today?  for a wide range of assets and financial products  financial institutions play a role as an  intermediary to connect and act on behalf of buyers and sellers  for some assets (e.g.  public stocks  liquid bonds)  formal markets exist to facilitate the  connection between buyers and sellers  typically in the form of exchanges  for less liquid and less standardised assets and products  demand and supply is often  dispersed  making direct discovery and connection among buyers and sellers highly  inefficient  for these assets and products  financial institutions aggregate demand and supply  and  build relationships with one another to effectively create a market  the so called over-the- counter (otc) market  as an intermediary  financial institutions sometimes take positions in the assets traded to  provide liquidity or offer advisory services to the buyers and sellers they represent  buyers intermediaries intermediaries sellers a b c d e f buyer 1 can be connected with seller 2  but not with seller  3 because their intermediaries do not have contact result: when 1 is buying from 3 trade is not executed at  the optimal price  evolution of otc driven activities key limitations of today’s model  over the years  the markets for standardised assets with high  transaction volume have greatly improved their efficiency by adopting  technologies to improve connectivity among buyers and sellers  however  otc markets still rely on relationship-based intermediaries  and non standardised processes to connect buyers and sellers  since the 2008 financial crisis  increased capital requirements and  reduced risk appetite among intermediary institutions have limited the  desirability of acting as a market maker  reducing liquidity for many  financial assets and products operational inefficiency highly manual discovery process  for the counterparties makes  transactions time consuming   costly and complex limited liquidity not all buyers and sellers at a  given moment are discovered by  one another  limiting liquidity suboptimal pricing no intermediaries  regardless of  their size  have a full view of the  demand and supply  making the  best price discovery difficult  limited visibility buyers and sellers have imperfect  visibility into the market supply   demand and counterparties   limiting their ability to exert control  over transactions limited access buyers’ ability to access assets is limited by their  intermediaries’ connections with sellers’ intermediaries market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers new platforms are emerging to connect intermediaries of buyers and sellers to  facilitate the flow of market information and the discovery of counterparties what are the new platforms?  leveraging technological innovations  a number of platforms have emerged  to redefine how buyers and sellers are connected for various financial assets  and products  improving the efficiency of those markets  these platforms automate and standardise collection of demand / supply  data from intermediaries or buyers and sellers to create an aggregated view  of the market and facilitate discovery of the most suitable counterparties  some platforms provide additional analyses on the data collected to better  inform buyers / sellers and their intermediaries in choosing their  counterparties buyers intermediaries intermediaries sellers a b c platform e f b buyer 1  seller 2 and seller 3 connected through new platform can  exchange information  result: all transactions are likely to be executed at an optimal price  examples of platforms improving connection between buyers  sellers and intermediaries fixed income funds / fund of funds private equity /  venture capital shares private company  shares private company  tenders commodities &  derivative contracts key characteristics of the platforms improving connection between buyers and sellers social standardisation automation these platforms embed the elements of social  networks to facilitate the interaction among  buyers  sellers and intermediaries and improve  how buyers and sellers are evaluated these platforms typically standardise what data  points are collected and analysed through a set  of sophisticated metrics to allow buyers to  evaluate sellers more critically these platforms automatically collect and  analyse data to help buyers and sellers make  more informed decisions and make the  discovery process less relationship-driven market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers these market connection platforms do not replace the traditional market-making  activities of intermediaries  but rather help them broaden their connections how do market connection platforms differ from traditional models of market making? value chain buyers intermediaries intermediaries sellers buyers traditional model market information/connection platforms intermediaries intermediaries sellers a b c d e f platform a b c d e f key characteristics advantages shortcomings  information about buyers and sellers (e.g.  current  inventory / demand  historical performance) is distributed  via relationships / awareness existing among their  intermediaries  intermediaries collect  analyse and act on the information  about the counterparties and the market  reduced chance of counterparty failure by transacting  through established  trusted intermediary relationships  reduced exposure to arbitrage attempts as demand and  supply is only visible to a small number of intermediaries  highly manual  relationship-based discovery and  assessment of demand and supply leading to inefficiency  potential to overlook the best price available due to the  limitation in the scale of each intermediary’s network  limited visibility of the transaction process to buyers and  sellers  intermediaries of buyers and sellers in some cases  are  directly discovered and connected via a central platform  information on counterparties and the market is  aggregated and analysed by the central platform for all  constituents in the market  more efficient discovery and assessment of demand and  supply in the market leading to more accurate price  formation  reduced need for financial institutions to take position in  assets and products to generate liquidity  increased visibility and control over transactions by buyers  and sellers  need to balance adequate price formation with potential  price discovery and arbitrage attempts  potential counterparty risks when dealing with  intermediaries (or buyers / sellers) without an established  relationship or reputation market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers as buyers  sellers and intermediaries become better connected via these  platforms  the overall efficiency of the market will improve key characteristics of the future markets enabled by improved market connections increased liquidity improved price accuracy transparency more intermediaries  and buyers and sellers   will be connected with one another to enable  more accurate assessment of demand and  supply in the market  leading to improved  liquidity in the market  as the aggregate demand and supply can be  assessed more accurately  intermediaries  and buyers / sellers will be able to determine  the best price more accurately without  revealing undesired information to the market buyers and sellers will gain more visibility  into the transaction process and therefore  will be able to exert greater control over the  transactions and reduce the opportunities for  suboptimal transactions by intermediaries  (e.g.  agent conflict of interest) improved access faster  cheaper transactions the ability to buy / sell financial assets and  products will be less dependent on the scale  or the size of the intermediaries' network   improving access to the market by more  buyers  sellers  and intermediaries as the discovery and assessment of  counterparties become more streamlined  and automated  the efficiency of  intermediaries will improve  leading to faster  turnaround and lower cost to complete  transactions for buyers and sellers how will the market landscape change for various financial assets and products as buyers and  sellers are better connected in the future? market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers how will the market landscape change for various financial assets and products as  buyers and sellers are better connected in the future? potential impact of buyer / seller connection levelling the playing field for newer   smaller institutions stabilising market

institutions have an advantage  over smaller institutions  new platforms will  allow demand and supply represented by  smaller institutions to be more readily  discovered by counterparties  these platforms will also provide fact- based measures to make counterparty  comparison and selection to be more  objective  enabling smaller institutions with  less developed networks of relationships to  compete  platforms are developed and used by larger  institutions to improve connectivity and  efficiency among a “group” of large  players  as connections among larger intermediaries  are strengthened by information/connection  platforms  the need for larger institutions to  connect with smaller intermediaries to  generate liquidity will decrease  effectively  building barriers of entry for smaller   newer institutions  as platforms grow  they may choose to  extend connections to individual  investors (e.g.  acting as brokerages)  when sufficient volume from individual  investors can be aggregated  these  platforms can act as a market for specific  assets and products and open doors for  sellers to easily broaden their buyer base to  the broader public  the following scenarios illustrate potential outcomes generated by the innovations discussed in this topic  particularly in response to the key  question above – they are not meant to be future predictions  these scenarios are illustrations of particular aspects of the potential future and are not meant to represent a complete view of the market and  competitive landscape – in many cases  some or all scenarios could be realised at the same time market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers scenario 1: levelling the playing field for newer  smaller institutions (1 / 2) buyers intermediaries sellers platform large large small large best match  large small narrative summary of impact market information / connection platforms open their doors to  intermediating institutions of all sizes. smaller institutions are particularly  incentivised to join such platforms as the platforms significantly expand  the intermediaries’ access to market information and connect them to a  universe of potential counterparties. as these platforms grow in scale  so will the pressure for greater trade  transparency and the use of more quantitative metrics for best execution.  as large intermediaries yield to client pressure to adopt these metrics   they will be more likely to interact with smaller intermediaries with whom  they may not have previously established working relationships.  standardised platforms facilitate connections between large and small  intermediating institutions to help them find counterparties;  considerably expanding the number of trading options for smaller  intermediaries  whose ability to connect with other institutions was  previously limited by scale  these platforms provide fact-based measures to improve the  objectivity of counterparty comparison and selection  enabling smaller  intermediaries to compete based on the interests of their clients and  their merits  instead of scale and reputation case studies novus is a portfolio intelligence platform that automatically gathers and analyses data on various funds’ performance to  provide visibility and transparency to fund-of-funds managers. traditionally  fund-of-funds managers discovered and  researched investment opportunities manually by contacting target funds. as a result  the ability of fund-of-funds to  source investment opportunities was dependent on their scale  reputation and network. through novus’ automated  platform  nearly all funds operating across the world and their performance are catalogued and analysed based on an  automated collection of regulatory reporting data. this allows smaller fund-of-funds to independently identify lucrative  investment opportunities without being limited by their reputation and the size of their networks. market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers scenario 1: levelling the playing field for newer  smaller institutions (2 / 2) necessary conditions for the scenario  top-level and line-level buy-in from large and small institutions for  adopting the information/connection platforms  intermediating institutions’ are comfortable with managing the risks  associated with transacting with less familiar  less pre-defined  counterparties  clients implications of the scenario on…  higher chance of achieving the best execution of  trades  customers’ ability to achieve optimal results is no longer  constricted by the size of their intermediaries   sources liquidity from the broadest group of counterparties  without risking discovery of demand / supply incumbents  traders are required to adapt to new behaviours  need to establish new processes to support the new  business model (in particular small institutions who might  need to improve their transparency and best execution  policies)  ecosystem  supports diversification of counterparties based on  asset specialisation opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks  incentivise deeper specialisation of intermediaries by creating higher  returns to specialization  potential increase in systemic resilience as the result of diversification  of related parties  transparency of counterparty selection is dependent on the  transparency of the information/connection platforms  increased counterparty risks when dealing with newer  smaller  counterparties without standing reputation or relationships market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers scenario 2: stabilising market framework for existing institutions (1 / 2) buyers intermediaries sellers large large small platform large best match  large small narrative summary of impact as standardised information/connection platforms gain popularity  a  “group” of large intermediaries may explore adopting the techniques  behind these platforms to create a streamlined  exclusive network among  themselves. these large institutions may acquire or partner with  standardised platforms to set up artificial barriers against smaller and  newer institutions. as these exclusive networks grow  it will become more difficult for smaller  institutions to find trading counterparties or compete with the efficiency  delivered by those networks.   as connections among larger intermediaries are strengthened by  platforms  the need for larger institutions to connect with smaller  intermediaries may decrease  effectively building barriers of entry for  smaller  newer institutions  smaller companies lack economies of scale to set up their own liquidity  network and may lose their customers to the larger institutions market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers scenario 2: stabilising market framework for existing institutions (2 / 2) necessary conditions for the scenario  regulatory tolerance of exclusive networks (e.g.  no collusion or  anti-trust concerns)  large institutions participating in exclusive networks do not  experience significant loss in liquidity by excluding smaller  institutions  continued customer confidence in large institutions to fulfill their  orders at a reasonably fair price clients implications of the scenario on…  liquidity may increase relative to the current state   but could be less than under an open platform  incumbents  large institutions retain strategic advantages over  smaller institutions ecosystem  increased concentration of trades among a small  number of intermediaries  increased difficulty for small intermediaries to  compete outside of niche specialties  creates barriers of entry for new intermediaries opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks  opportunities for large institutions to continue to be highly influential in  the market landscape  shifting transactions from obscure internal execution facilities to more  transparent standardised platforms  encouraging concentration of transactions among few large institutions  public and regulatory agencies may perceive exclusive networks as an  unfair  colluding activity market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers scenario 3: opening the doors to individual investors (1 / 2) buyers intermediaries sellers large small platform large best match  small narrative summary of impact under the current market structure individual investors cannot directly  participate in markets for many assets because information about supply  and demand is disparate and disorganised. as the growth of  information/connection platforms improves visibility into these asset  classes  the platforms may choose to expand their offerings to provide  access for qualified individual investors.  using these platforms  individual investors are able to transact directly  with one another or can aggregate their demand/supply to interact with  institutional investors. as engagement with individual investors grows   some platforms may choose to evolve to play the role of a broker.  as platforms grow  they choose to extend their connections to  individual investors  enabling them to bypass traditional intermediaries  and transact with one another  these information/connection platforms may help individual investors  represent their aggregate demand and supply more effectively to  institutional buyers and sellers   if sufficient volume can be aggregated from individual investors  these  platforms can effectively act as a market for specific assets and  products  and open doors for sellers to broaden their buyer base case studies liquity provides private company directors with a comprehensive suite of shareholder and equity management services  and match investors with private company shareholders who want to sell some or all of their equity. liquity facilitates  complete deals  from introduction to transaction completion including escrow and custodial services. market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers scenario 3: opening the doors to individual investors (2 / 2) necessary conditions for the scenario implications of the scenario on…  appetite for individual investors with high degree of financial  sophistication to directly participate in trades clients  ability to make direct connections with trade  counterparties  development of execution infrastructure to facilitate trades with  individual investors who do not possess over-the-counter capabilities  ability to aggregate sufficient demand and supply volume among  individual investors to transact with institutional investors  access to new asset classes for individual investors  improved transparency and control over the transaction  process incumbents  erosion of market shares to brokers and groupings of  groups of high net worth individuals  impetus for intermediaries to strengthen values they  provide to clients beyond transaction facilitation ecosystem  increased liquidity on standardised platforms opportunities and risks associated with the scenario opportunities risks  opportunities to separate transactional services from high-value   advisory offerings  opportunities to engage new buyers and sellers in the market   increasing liquidity and diversifying the needs and opinions of market  participants  potential for sophisticated individual investors to make errors due to  lack of specialised knowledge (relative to professional intermediaries)  increased burden on regulatory agencies as more parties are directly  involved in the market market provisioning: connecting buyers and sellers what does this mean for financial institutions? key implications and remaining questions “safe bets” – likely implications under all scenarios  less differentiation among intermediaries: as the ability to fulfill the transaction needs of customers become commoditised by market  connection platforms  financial intermediaries will be less differentiated by their capabilities  redistributed negotiating power: with both counterparties and their intermediaries gaining improved visibility into market demand and supply   negotiating power will be redistributed based on actual demand and supply resulting in more efficient pricing  shift to advisory models: as the financial intermediaries’ role in counterparty discovery and negotiation diminishes  their ability to build customer  relationships based on advice will become more important to their competitiveness  how will financial intermediaries differentiate from one another as improved information flow and trading connections reduce the gaps in institutions’  ? ability to find counterparties for their customers? scenario 1: levelling the playing field for  newer  smaller institutions scenario 2: stabilising market framework for  existing institutions  scenario 3: opening the doors to individual  investors  reduced fee structure: as the cost of  fulfilling transactions falls  the fee structure  of intermediation services  as well as actual  products themselves (e.g.  carry on funds)   may be reduced regardless of client size ?  how will larger financial institutions continue  to maintain advantage over smaller players  when economies of scale are eroded and  smaller players can gain access the same  information and counterparties?  direct investments by established  institutions: established intermediaries will  become more active in investing   implementing  and acquiring market  connection platforms to stablise the current  market framework  how will established intermediaries gain  ? exclusive access to market connection  platforms while avoiding conflict-of-interest  (i.e.  best execution) and anti-trust issues? implications ? remaining questions  reduced value proposition to  institutional customers: as some  institutional customers choose to directly  discover and transact with counterparties  via market connection platforms  their  stickiness on other institutional services   such as asset management and investment  banking  may decrease ?  what additional value will financial  intermediaries provide high net worth  individuals to prevent the erosion of their  businesses by direct access to  counterparties via market connection  platforms? contact details for additional information please contact: world economic forum core project team professional services support from

findings world economic forum the world economic forum’s analysis has yielded six key findings regarding the implications of distributed ledger technology (dlt) on the future of financial services key findings dlt has great potential to drive simplicity and efficiency through the establishment of new financial services infrastructure and processes dlt is not a panacea; instead it should be viewed as one of many technologies that will form the foundation of next‐ generation financial services infrastructure applications of dlt will differ by use case each leveraging the technology in different ways for a diverse range of benefits digital identity is a critical enabler to broaden applications to new verticals; digital fiat (legal tender) along with other emerging capabilities has the ability to amplify benefits the most impactful dlt applications will require deep collaboration between incumbents innovators and regulators adding complexity and delaying implementation new financial services infrastructure built on dlt will redraw processes and call into question orthodoxies that are foundational to today’s business models these key findings are explored in depth in the following pages based on the use case deep‐dives conducted across financial services. world economic forum distributed ledger technology has great potential to drive simplicity and efficiency through the establishment of new financial services infrastructure and processes the following six key value drivers for dlt were identified through the in‐depth examination of nine use cases from across financial services. value drivers operational simplification dlt reduces / eliminates manual efforts required to perform reconciliation and resolve disputes regulatory efficiency improvement dlt enables real‐time monitoring of financial activity between regulators and regulated entities counterparty risk reduction dlt challenges the need to trust counterparties to fulfil obligations as agreements are codified and executed in a shared immutable environment clearing and settlement time reduction dlt disintermediates third parties that support transaction verification / validation and accelerates settlement liquidity and capital improvement dlt reduces locked‐in capital and provides transparency into sourcing liquidity for assets fraud minimization dlt enables asset provenance and full transaction history to be established within a single source of truth world economic forum distributed ledger technology is not a panacea; instead it should be viewed as one of many technologies that will form the foundation of next‐generation financial services infrastructure over the last years technology innovation has been fundamental to financial services industry transformation. today  multiple technologies poised to drive the next wave of financial services innovation are converging in maturity. 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s emerging technologies future r o t c u d n o c i m

cognitive computing distributed ledger technology machine learning / predictive analytics quantum computing robotics credit cards messaging services (e.g. swift) atms electronic trading digital banking dlt is one of many transformative new technologies that will shape future financial services infrastructure and should be seen as part of a toolbox world economic forum applications of distributed ledger technology will differ by use case each leveraging the technology in different ways for a diverse range of benefits examples of dlt value drivers and benefits use case trade finance automated compliance global payments value driver benefits operational simplification enables real‐time multi‐party tracking and management of letters of credit and enables faster automated settlement regulatory efficiency improvement provides faster and more accurate reporting by automating compliance processes that draw on immutable data sources settlement time reduction enables the near real‐time point‐to‐point transfer of funds between financial institutions (fis) removing friction and accelerating settlement asset rehypothecation liquidity and capital improvement provides market participants with an improved line of sight into assets enabling improved risk evaluation and decision‐making world economic forum digital identity is a critical enabler to broaden applications to new verticals; digital fiat (legal tender) along with other emerging capabilities has the ability to amplify benefits digital identity digital fiat future innovations correct identity information is critical to ensuring financial transactions are accurate and compliant – but integrating physical identity protocols with dlt creates frictions and increases the potential for errors dlt systems are frequently denominated with tokens that are native to the system – but users of formal financial infrastructure will demand high levels of liquidity between assets on the system and fiat currency e t a t s t n e r r u c the advent of the fourth industrial revolution is rapidly altering the financial system and broader economy through the exponential acceleration of innovation r a fully digital system for storing and transferring identity attributes could be directly integrated into distributed financial infrastructure s • faster and accurate anti‐money laundering (aml) and know‐your‐client (kyc) processes • seamless customer onboarding • improved counterparty matching l e b a n e y t i l i b a p a c t i f e n e b e r u t u f distributed fiat currencies issued by central banks could be employed within distributed financial infrastructure ensuring the availability of liquidity even in the event of systemic instability opportunities for integration may emerge between distributed financial infrastructure and a range of innovations such as artificial intelligence or the rapidly evolving internet of things • settlement to liquid cash‐equivalent tokens issued by a central bank • elimination of the need for an inefficient bridge between cash and new financial infrastructure ? the potential benefits of these integrations are highly uncertain world economic forum the most impactful dlt applications will require deep collaboration between incumbents innovators and regulators adding complexity and delaying implementation updating financial infrastructure through dlt will require significant time and investment. three key observations must be taken into consideration for this implementation to be successful. key observations and insights replacing existing financial infrastructure by dlt will require significant time and investment infrastructure replacement competing interests aligning key stakeholders for collective action will require difficult balancing of interests in the face of diverging interests and zero‐sum games implementing new financial infrastructure will require changes to existing regulations standards of practice and the creation of new legal and liability frameworks. specifically the implementation of smart contracts will require additional stakeholder alignment and governance considerations legal regulatory and governance frameworks achieving all three key observations will delay large‐scale multi‐party dlt implementations in highly regulated markets. however if successful these could enable scalable infrastructure fabrics industry‐wide solutions and standardized processes world economic forum a b c new financial services infrastructure built on dlt will redraw processes and call into question orthodoxies that are foundational to today’s business models assumptions that are central to today’s financial business models will be impacted both intentionally and unintentionally by the shift to distributed financial infrastructure requiring incumbents to adjust their business practices in response. current‐state assumptions transformative characteristics of distributed infrastructure implications for market participants within financial services information silos drive the need for detailed reconciliation activities lack of a single version of the truth and audit trails creates arbitrage concerns asymmetric information between market participants drives the proliferation of central authorities lack of transparency increases regulations on fis a) immutability b) transparency eliminates need for reconciliation provides historical single version of the truth eliminates imbalance of information among market participants increases cooperation between regulators and regulated entities lack of trust between counterparties creates the need for central authority oversight in contract execution c) autonomy ensures agreements are executed to agreed upon business outcomes disintermediates supporting entities established to resolve disputes world economic forum a distributed ledger technology will question the need for individual books of record through immutable and distributed record‐keeping dlt provides transaction immutability which is a key requirement for eliminating the need for an enforcer of trust in the ecosystem. tamper‐proof distributed data enables an environment in which trust is not an issue and allows counterparties to operate with a single version of the truth. current state traditionally asset and transaction information was stored within physical books to independently reference previous actions internally and externally. as technologies advanced physical books were translated into digital ledgers today every fi maintains its own digital “book of record” repository as a result central intermediaries proliferate in the industry providing unbiased reconciliation services to facilitate transactions between counterparties without requiring them to trust each other. for transactions executed internal to the organization reconciliation is performed within lines of businesses dlt transformative potential at its core dlt is a growing repository of transactions organized in chronological blocks where the technology intrinsically makes changes to previous transactions functionally impossible dlt has been designed to replicate data among participating nodes in real time ensuring all parties operate off of a single version of the truth at all times financial services implications challenges information silos between market participants and eliminates the need for inter‐firm reconciliation disintermediates central intermediaries and reduces the fear of arbitrage within the ecosystem enables audit trails to be established for assets and transactions with a significant reduction in disputes world economic forum b distributed ledger technology will significantly increase transparency between market participants infrastructure must be capable of sharing information among all market participants. dlt builds upon a single version of the truth to provide transparency for historical and real‐time transactions. current state the age and fragmentation of large parts of existing financial infrastructure have placed limits on the degree of transparency these systems are able to offer creating opportunities for information asymmetry as a result some actors within the ecosystem have gained competitive advantages through the imbalance of information while some entities profit from this state of information others experience suboptimal performance and spend excessive resources on risk hedging and liquidity guarantees dlt transformative potential the “default setting” of dlt is to provide full transparency into transactions dlt has the potential to transform existing notions of private records in which transaction details are only known to counterparties dlt can promote the creation of a public record of activity in the ecosystem to which all market participants have access in real time financial services implications challenges existing competitive advantage models that leverage information asymmetry reduces the role of supporting entities (e.g. insurers) that profit from opacity within the ecosystem promotes discourse in the ecosystem where transparency best serves market participants vs where opacity is needed (e.g. secure personally identifiable information data) world economic forum b distributed ledger technology will have implications for the cost of leverage by reducing information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders dlt enables improved visibility into the ways in which assets are being employed through the tokenization of assets and a public record of transactions. current state in a wide variety of transactions types fis may loan or pledge assets to provide or receive access to credit; however limited visibility exists into how many times an asset has been loaned or pledged this limited line‐of‐sight into liens against an asset enables that asset to be used to secure multiple debts by the borrowers often in excess of nominal asset value this opacity causes lenders to rely upon reputational factors and assessments by supporting entities such as rating agencies dlt transformative potential dlt can tokenize individual assets (e.g. property and bonds) on a shared and trusted ledger to establish provenance dlt can provide visibility into assets and associated liabilities based on transactional history while increasing the efficiency of credit transactions financial services implications promotes visibility of assets and associated liens/ownerships to quantify risk and increase pricing accuracy reduces access to capital for borrowers by limiting the ability to use the same asset to secure leverage from multiple parties challenges the role of rating entities in quantifying risks world economic forum b distributed ledger technology will transform the relationship between regulators and regulated entities reducing frictions and improving outcomes transactional data must provide granularity and accuracy to regulators in order to monitor and comply with regulatory obligations. dlt facilitates transparency between regulators and regulated entities through a shared repository with real‐time access to data. current state regulated entities and regulators are increasingly challenged to support information requirements to certify compliance while regulated entities are committed to enable transparency significant costs and risks are associated with current systems and business processes as complexity within the ecosystem and financial instruments increases the trade‐off between transparency and cost becomes a balancing act dlt transformative potential dlt can become a shared data repository between regulators and regulated entities breaking down organizational silos dlt has the potential to allow subsets of transactional data to be effortlessly shared with regulators in real‐time dlt can facilitate ‘regulatory‐inclusive’ business models in which regulators utilize smart contracts to verify transactions / deals in real‐time financial services implications transforms compliance from post‐transaction monitoring to on‐demand and immediate monitoring improves capability of regulators to fulfil their mandate of ensuring the legality security and stability of financial markets improves efficiency for regulators to monitor trading venues such as over‐the‐counter markets and dark pools reduces regulatory compliance costs significantly world economic forum c distributed ledger technology will reduce the need for intermediaries by providing autonomous execution capabilities financial agreements are enforced via a complex set of business rules and processes to ensure obligations are fulfilled by counterparties. dlt provides the ability to autonomously execute these conditions in a shared and trusted environment. current state all transactions involving at least two market participants are governed by agreements that highlight business outcomes based on obligations that must be met by each counterparty the responsibility for ensuring these agreements are enforcements dependent on legal and regulatory frameworks as a result the complexity of these agreements has given rise to intermediaries that mediate disputes between parties and resolve deviations within agreed upon outcomes dlt transformative potential dlt can codify financial agreements in a shared platform and guarantee execution based on mutually agreed conditions limiting unilateral counterparty actions dlt can eliminate the manual effort required to support the execution of financial agreements and can accelerate business outcomes financial services implications reduces counterparty risk due to the reduced need to trust counterparties’ willingness or ability to fulfil obligations disintermediates entities that currently mediate disputes and resolve business outcomes world economic forum additional research remains to assess distributed ledger technology feasibility quantify benefits and analyze implementation details past approaches our approach future approaches top‐down approach bottom‐up approach solution‐first methodology problem‐first methodology technology focus

financial services infrastructure support existing conversations to implement dlt and initiate new discussions elsewhere throughout the use case deep‐dives a broad set of assumptions regarding dlt had to be developed. world economic forum each use case deep‐dive maintained a consistent focus and set of assumptions our focus • understanding the direct impacts that dlt can have at the business‐process level on fis and other market participants analysing use cases that are broadly applicable in global financial markets occasionally utilizing us regulations as reference points identifying critical conditions for the successful implementation of dlt across the following four categories: stakeholder alignment: achievement of shared benefits technology: implementation dependencies regulatory: compliance‐related requirements governance: administration and liability oversight our assumptions a note on security considerations 1. we assume that enabling capabilities (e.g. digital identity) are available to be incorporated in conjunction with distributed ledger technology to meet each use case’s goals securely and effectively 2. we assume that distributed ledger solutions implemented in the near future will be scalable to meet volume requirements (including in some cases billions of transactions) 3. we assume data sources that are accessible by distributed ledgers and/or facilitate autonomy cannot be compromised 4. we understand that benefits realized will be contingent on specific business models for each fi and jurisdictional uniqueness similar to any technological innovation dlt comes with a set of risks that must be considered: 1. ensuring that distributed ledgers are secure and safeguarded against errors is paramount to the long‐term success of the technology and should not be treated the same as fundamentally questioning the strength of the protocol 2. while smart contracts enable autonomous agreement execution between parties they rely on architects and security experts to build business rules that prevent malicious behaviour complete thorough end‐to‐end testing and verify all code 3. meticulous it controls must be in place to detect potential gaps in security across all the inputs components and outputs of dlt world economic forum through the deep‐dives a number of characteristics were discovered that should be utilized to identify other high‐potential use cases in financial services through the examination of nine use cases a set of common characteristics were identified that appeared to be shared by high‐ potential applications of dlt characteristics of high‐potential use cases example shared repository a shared repository of information is used by multiple parties ledger that stores financial assets in which an owner and owned assets are tracked and shared with other internal/external parties (e.g. regulators and other geographical units) multiple writers more than one entity generates transactions that require modifications to the shared repository minimal trust a level of mistrust exists between entities that generate transactions payments system collectively managed and maintained by a small group of banks but each bank has millions of end users transacting with their bank multiple parties within a trade finance arrangement (e.g. importer exporter issuing bank receiving bank correspondent banks and customs) that do not “trust” each other and therefore institute layers of verification and impose collateral requirements intermediaries one (or multiple) intermediary or a central gatekeeper is present to enforce trust removing and/or reducing the importance of a central intermediary whose primary role is to provide “trust” to the post‐trade ecosystem transaction dependencies interaction or dependency between transactions is created by different entities a situation in which alice needs to send funds to bob then bob needs to send funds to charlie. bob’s transaction is dependent on alice’s transaction and one cannot verify bob’s transaction without checking alice’s first world economic forum section use case deep‐dive summaries world economic forum reading guide this section

utilized to match trades world economic forum section use case deep‐dive modules world economic forum section 5.1 payments: global payments world economic forum global payments introduction a payment refers to the process of transferring value from one individual or organization to another in exchange for goods services or the fulfillment of a legal obligation. global payments are an expansion of that concept in which payments can be completed across geographical borders through multiple fiat currencies. current‐state background key ecosystem stakeholders overview money sender and beneficiary regulator local clearing network swift correspondent bank money transfer operator sender bank beneficiary bank business is growing fast and steadily the global payments volume is increasing at an approximate rate of 5% yearly worldwide and will reach an estimated us$ billion in 2016.1 revenue is growing in all regions especially in asia where china will likely surpass brazil as the third largest payment area after the united states and the eurozone2 profit margins are high: the average cost to the final customer (money sender) is 7.68% of the amount transferred • newcomers are arriving: non‐bank transactions are reaching up to 10% of the total payments volume2 the focus of this use case is on low value−high volume payments from an individual/business to an individual via banks or money transfer operators. these transfers are more commonly known as remittances world economic forum 1. migration and remittances factbook world bank 2016. 2. top trends in payments in

ensure educated and empowered investors: tokenized bond instruments can enable investors to make informed data‐ driven decisions; improved monitoring processes can reduce market uncertainty allow point‐in‐time stress tests to become irrelevant: smart contracts can alert regulators when loan absorption needs to be activated while ensuring that “over‐reporting” is not a concern business drivers: since loan absorption is an indication that a broader crisis may be taking place is reduced market volatility enough of a driver to warrant investment? world economic forum section 5.6 investment

conditions incorporating “net transaction” benefits within settlement achieving multistakeholder alignment across participants standardizing reference data utilized to match trades custodian banks and regulators will need to work together to determine if and how to incorporate the benefits achieved by netting in order to minimize transactions and money transferred across custodian banks regulators custodian banks and exchanges must work in partnership to develop a solution that can handle billions of dollars in daily transaction volume while providing the economies of scale to benefit players of all sizes custodian banks will need to work together to develop a standardized set of data fields that can match trades while providing investor anonymity and confidence in automation why? ccps aggregate executed trades to optimize the movement of assets; the inability to perform similar activities may add inefficiencies to settlement why? given the complexity of post‐trade processes all entities involved must be willing to directly participate with one another to ensure market stability why? the inability to standardize this data will cause manual post‐trade validation processes to still be required inhibiting the disintermediation of ccps and csds challenge since smart contracts execute commands in real time batching trades with some predefined frequency may require customization challenge if ccps will be disintermediated as a result of a successful implementation of dlt governance and collaboration will be required to ensure a liability model exists in case technology failures occur challenge since traditional data fields used to match can change frequently (e.g. bank details) significant collaboration is required to standardize attributes that are not

facilitation location services) level (location services) the value web (event facilitation) world economic forum executive summary world economic forum the blueprint for digital identity project is the most recent phase of the forum’s ongoing disruptive innovation in financial services work the future of financial services the future of financial services project explored the landscape of disruptive innovations in financial services provided the first consolidated taxonomy for these disruptions and explored their potential impacts on the structure of the industry beyond the future of financial services this phase of the disruptive innovation work explores two topics with key potential as foundational enablers of future disruption a blueprint for digital identity: the role of financial institutions in building digital identity this project explores the potential for digital identity in financial services and beyond and lays out a blueprint for the implementation of effective digital identity systems the future of financial infrastructure: an ambitious look at how blockchain can reshape financial services this project explores the potential for distributed ledger technology to transform the infrastructure of the financial services industry the mandate of this project was to explore digital identity and understand the role that financial institutions should play in building a global standard for digital identity project context identity is a critical topic in financial services today. current identity systems are limiting fintech innovation and well as secure and efficient service delivery in financial services and society more broadly. digital identity is widely recognized as the next step in identity systems. however while many efforts are underway to solve parts of the identity challenge and create true digital identity there is a need for a concerted and coordinated effort to build a truly transformational digital identity system. this document is intended as a guide for chief strategy officers of financial institutions as well as policy makers who are interested in the topic of identity and want to understand the digital identity and their own potential role in the creation of robust digital identity systems. project scope the mandate of this project was to explore identity and its importance in fintech financial services and in developed societies broadly the topic of digital identity and provide a landscape scan of current efforts to build digital identity solutions. this report will discuss different structures for identity systems and discuss which configurations are best suited to solve different problems and provide a perspective on the role of financial institutions in building digital identity systems. this report will not focus on the creation of standards around identity; much valuable work has already been done in this space and current developments such as the publication of the european union eidas regulation are moving the conversation on this front. nor will it discuss technology solutions. rather it will attempt to provide clarity and direction around the structure of identity and provide a call to action for financial institutions to move against the identity challenge. world economic forum over months of research we engaged with subject matter experts through interviews and multi‐stakeholder workshops industry leaders guidance and thought leadership from c‐suite executives and strategy officers of global financial institutions subject matter experts in‐person and phone interviews with 100+ subject matter and industry experts global workshops four multi‐stakeholder workshops at global financial hubs with 200+ total participants including industry leaders innovators subject matter experts and regulators singapore oct. new york usa nov. london uk dec. davos switzerland jan. world economic forum this report synthesizes our findings and presents a point of view on the role that we see for financial institutions in digital identity project outcomes our perspective: the role of financial institutions in digital identity how should financial institutions engage with digital identity? what role can they play in the development of digital identity solutions? introduction what is the global identity challenge and what problems does it pose for financial institutions? digital identity primer what is the purpose of identity systems and why is digital identity the solution to the global identity challenge? the landscape of digital identity what do efforts to build digital identity systems look like globally? the right solution to the right problem how should digital identity systems be constructed to serve different needs? benefits of digital identity who stands to benefit from the introduction of digital identity systems? implementation how do you reach a global digital identity solution? world economic forum the role of financial  institutions in digital identity current identity systems place major limitations on fintech innovation lack of digital identity limits the development and delivery of efficient secure digital‐based fintech offerings identity is currently a critical pain point for fintech innovators. many of these innovators are trying to deliver pure digital offerings but the process of identifying users consistently forces them to use physical channels. these fintech innovators now see the development of a new generation of digital identity systems as being crucial to continuing innovation and delivering efficient secure digital‐based fintech offerings. examples payments payments require validation of ach information meaning that digital payments innovators must either require users to provide identity information through pseudo‐digital channels (such as by photographing their driver’s license) or act as platforms on top of established financial institutions and rely on their kyc processes loans evaluating customer risk and issuing loans requires validation of basic customer information requiring innovators to gather information from users again through pseudo‐digital channels such as photographing existing id or gathering trusted information from an existing source and therefore decentralizing a central piece of the product offering world economic forum digital identity is a critical enabler of activity inside financial services broadly digital identity would allow fis to perform critical activities with increased accuracy over that afforded by physical identity  and to streamline and partially or fully automate many processes identity is also central to the broader financial services industry enabling delivery of basic financial products ands services. reliance on physical identity protocols introduces inefficiency and error to these processes. digital identity has great potential to improve core financial services processes and open up new opportunities. examples operational decisions traditional fs offerings such as insurance and credit and well as customer experience such as contact centers and collections rely on accurate and detailed knowledge of the customer regulatory compliance fis are required to comply with strict regulation on identifying their customers and are liable for mistakes and inaccuracies customer experience and product delivery improved knowledge of customer preferences and habits can help fis deliver radically better customer experience (e.g. tailor authentication requirements based on behaviour) world economic forum the relevance of digital identity stretches beyond financial services to society as a whole identity enables many societal transactions making strong identity systems critical to the function of society as a whole physical identity systems currently put users at risk due to overexposure of information and the high risk of information loss or theft; they also put society at risk due to the potential for identity theft allowing illicit actors to access public and private services. digital identity would streamline and re‐risk completion of these public and private transactions. public transactions private transactions entities are required to prove their identities or certain attributes to demonstrate their eligibility for public services examples • access to social assistance (e.g. old age security unemployment insurance) • access to education • access to healthcare • access to civic structures (e.g. voting) entities are often required to prove their identities or certain attributes to participate in private transactions examples • many basic merchant transactions (e.g. buying alcohol) • large private provider transactions (e.g. renting an apartment buying a car) world economic forum the need for digital identity is becoming increasingly pressing five key trends are increasingly the need for efficient and effective identity systems: increasing transaction volumes the number of identity‐dependent transactions is growing through increased use of the digital channel and increasing connectivity between entities increasing transaction complexity transactions increasingly involve very disparate entities without previously established relationships (e.g. customers and businesses transacting cross‐border) rising customer expectations customers expect seamless omni‐channel service delivery and will migrate to services that offer the best customer experience more stringent regulatory requirements regulators are demanding increased transparency around transactions meaning that fis require greater granularity and accuracy in the identity information that they capture and are increasingly being held liable for inaccurate or missing identity information increasing speed of financial / reputational damage bad actors in financial systems are increasing sophisticated in the technology and tools that they use to conduct illicit activity increasing their ability to quickly cause financial and reputational damage by exploiting weak identity systems world economic forum however identity is a multi‐layered problem making the creation of digital identity systems complex each layer of identity of serves a different purpose and suffers from a distinct set of problems in today’s identity landscape goals providing efficient effective and seamless services to users provisioning what services users are entitled to access based on their attributes providing mechanisms for exchanging attributes between parties providing mechanisms for linking users to attributes capturing and storing user attributes developing standards to govern system operation service delivery authorization problems inefficient or unsuited service delivery complex authorization rules and relationships attribute exchange insecure and privacy‐ compromising attribute exchange authentication weak or inconvenient authentication attribute collection standards inaccurate or insufficient attribute collection lack of coordination and consistency there are currently many distinct gaps in the digital identity landscape 1. confusing authentication with identity many efforts today focus on authentication as a solution to the identity challenge without addressing the strength of the underlying attribute collection and authorization processes • authentication technology solutions while valuable rely on preexisting onboarding and attribute collection processes • authentication solutions provided by global technology platforms are convenient for users but do not provide security or verification of the identity behind an account or username 2. enabling transaction completion rather than user activity many solutions are driven by the goals and perspectives of a single organization and therefore are designed to serve the needs of particular transactions rather the broader needs of users • egovernment solutions are intended to make government service delivery to users more efficient and do not enable further transactions in which users might want to participate • transaction‐focussed solutions result in the repeated collection of ‘tombstone’ data rather than effective collection of user‐centric and risk‐relevant data such as transaction habits 3. building consensus rather than driving action many efforts focus on building agreement around standards and processes rather than creating a full identity solution and therefore do not result in private sector‐implementable solutions • utilities and standards organizations are focussed on creating consensus and a standardized view of data rather than providing a full identity solution • multi‐governmental efforts have considerable scale but are mainly focussed at the regulatory level and do not offer a commercially viable solutions world economic forum these gaps are a result of the crowded digital identity landscape with many different entities building solutions technology solution providers technology solution providers focus on point solutions for authentication attribute exchange or identity management for enterprises private service providers private service providers focus on collecting the attributes they themselves need to provide specific services to users global technology companies global technology companies act as platforms to authenticate users to a wide variety of other service providers service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development industry bodies industry bodies focus on standardizing and centralizing the collection of attributes within that specific industry governments governments focus on the provision of identity to their citizens and providing citizens with services based on these attributes standards organizations standards organizations focus on frameworks and guidance for developing identity systems service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standard development world economic forum there is an opening for new digital identity systems that can deliver scope and scale while many ongoing efforts such as new authentication solutions are critical to building digital identity there is a core need for a strong system will enable effective action against each layer of the stack the entire stack does not need to be provided by a single entity – some components may be modular – but the entire stack must be effective and integrated to provide digital identity systems that have certain critical features service delivery authorization attribute exchange authentication attribute collection standards critical characteristics of a strong identity system operationally effective the system allows digital transactions to be completed conveniently and effectively scope scale the system enables large volumes of transactions through provision of transaction‐critical attributes and connecting large numbers of users with important and frequently used service providers security the system prevents user information from being overexposed lost or stolen user control privacy the system allows users to determine where their information is held and when it is shared or exposed viability the system delivers value to all stakeholders creating broad support and uptake and making it a commercially viable system world economic forum financial institutions are well positioned to drive the creation of digital identity systems financial institutions are exceptionally well positioned to drive identity systems that fill the gaps left by current efforts structural fis already act as stores of customer attributes for their own commercial purposes and therefore are positioned to act as identity providers without extensive incremental effort fis are one of very few types of institutions that can verify user information; they already perform this function for commercial and regulatory purposes fis are incentivized to collect accurate user information for their own commercial purposes fis have proven executional ability to develop new systems and standards (e.g. interac) that have been widely adopted and effectively used within the private sector the fs industry has near‐complete coverage of users (people legal entities and assets) in developed economies global fis have interconnected operations across multiple jurisdictions giving them a structural advantage in enabling cross‐ jurisdictional identity transactions and systems positioning fi operations and use of customer data are rigorously regulated fis act as established intermediaries in many transactions and are therefore well positioned to act as identity intermediaries fis are typically trusted by consumers beyond other institutions to be safe repositories of information and assets world economic forum there is a strong business case for financial institutions to lead the development of digital identity systems fis could derive substantial benefit from investing in the development of digital identity solutions. we have categorized these benefits into three categories: efficiency / cost avoidance new revenue opportunities brand enhancement and transformational future state opportunities efficiency / cost avoidance new revenue opportunities transformational future state opportunities opportunities to streamline current processes increase automation and reduce error and human intervention opportunities to create new revenue streams from new products and services and to increase the positive recognition of the brand opportunities to stretch outside of core business and capabilities to create transformational new business models and reach new customers world economic forum financial institutions could benefit from basic efficiency improvements and cost avoidance… efficiency / cost avoidance process streamlining automation streamline and improve onboarding and compliance processes through access to a reliable and consolidated digital view of user attributes minimizing rfis and information remediation due to inaccuracy and human error improved service delivery provide increasingly tailored products and services to customers by leveraging non‐traditional attributes improve process efficiency and increase stp by automating processes through use of standardized reliable digital data improved customer experience improve customer experience by leveraging a variety of user attributes to better understanding the customer’s needs and preferences improved risk assessment scoring improve risk assessment and reduce fraud by creating more holistic and accurate customer risk profiles to inform suspicious transaction monitoring insurance payouts and provision of credit‐ and risk‐based products world economic forum develop new revenue streams… new revenue opportunities new financial products services offer new products and services based on increased knowledge of customers (e.g. extended financial advisory new insurance products such as insurance on fractionally owned assets and behaviour‐based insurance) identity‐as‐a‐service offer identity as a service to relying parties who cannot or do not wish to store customer information identity‐only customers offer identity as a separate fee‐based service for individuals who do not otherwise transact with that fi world economic forum … and stretch beyond current business and markets to fundamentally transform their businesses transformational future state opportunities allocation of liability shift the liability for incorrect information and the outcomes of holding this information from financial institutions to other entities in the network (e.g. users through approval and consent requirements) trust brokerage act as a ‘broker of trust’ in previously trustless interactions between disparate parties in multiple industries expanding the reach of fis beyond the fs industry and reaching new profit pools disruption of the credit bureau model evaluate customer creditworthiness based on accurate identity data including preferences and financial history rather than relying on third parties and the mining of multiple different data sources refocussing around the customer refocus business around customer service assisting with day‐to‐day decisioning and blurring the lines between financial and non‐financial advisory public sector partnerships become the trusted identity provider of the public sector assisting with social services and civic requirements such as tax filing world economic forum we are calling on fis to champion the development of digital identity systems fis should champion efforts to build digital identity systems driving the building and implementation of identity platforms through the creation of minimum viable digital identity systems requirements of a minimum viable identity system identity provision identity provider(s) that hold trusted information and have coverage over a critical mass of users within their target area and can therefore serve a large number of users and transactions high‐transaction volume attributes secure storage of verified attributes that are required for common transactions (inherent attributes such as name date of birth nationality national identifier number and some assigned attributes such as address) relying party adoption involvement of relying parties that offer important and frequently used user‐facing services technology platform a technology platform that enables secure attribute exchange between identity providers and relying parties with a convenient user consent mechanism (e.g. operates on mobile and desktop) system standards supervisory liability standards that guide operation and use of user information in the system and provide liability and user recourse legal regulatory acceptance legal regulatory acceptance for using third‐party verified information attribute exchange and external use of user information world economic forum fis could take several different approaches to creating identity systems there are different configuration options for the development of digital identity systems each with advantages and drawbacks single‐institution consortium utility global institutions could create internal systems that stretch across the jurisdictions in which they operate this would enable quick implementation but a single institution would likely have difficulty in gaining a critical mass of users limiting its ability to drive system adoption and integration of relying parties consortiums of financial institutions could form networks that cover large contained oligopoly economies (such as canada or australia) a consortium requires a high degree of collaboration among parties but is an effective method of getting complete coverage over a user group consortiums are well suited to provide identity for individuals as data storage is not centralized increasing privacy and system resilience financial institutions could create industry utilities to deliver identity services across the industry this model is effective in creating standardization and broad coverage but implementation may be difficult due to the involvement of many different stakeholders utilities are a good model for legal entity and asset identity because they provide a standardized view and golden record of information world economic forum this report will provide guidance on constructing effective and robust digital identity systems while avoiding implementation pitfalls implementation of identity systems is extremely sensitive and therefore easy to get wrong; situational operational and cultural factors all have important implications for identity systems and implementation or operational failure has extremely negative consequences for both the drivers of identity system (e.g. wasted resources) and for users (e.g. data breaches). we have studied the landscape of identity providers to understand what efforts are ongoing and which system models are best suited to different situations and to provide recommendations on system configuration and implementation. 6. implementation interconnection call to action highlights the next steps and key stakeholders that must be involved to successfully implement a digital identity network 5. benefits of digital identity introduces the stakeholders that are involved in a digital identity network and the types of benefits each stakeholder may derive blueprint for digital identity 1. introduction introduces the global identity challenge and how problems with identity manifest for financial institutions 2. digital identity primer summarizes key digital identity concepts 3. the landscape of digital identity systems describes the landscape of digital identity solutions and introduces a set of archetypes that represent the existing set of solutions 4. the right solution to the right problem discusses how identity solutions should be configured for success world economic forum the global identity challenge identity is critical to today’s society identity is foundational to many of the transactions that occur in today’s society. in any exchange with requirements about the transacting parties – they must be a certain age or reside in a certain jurisdiction – structures must be in place that allow entities to determine certain information about their counterparty and to have confidence that the information is true. how do i know this entity is what it claims to be? how do we know this person is who they claim to be? what do they need to know about me? can we transact with this person? how do i know they won’t misuse my information? how can we deliver the right services to this person? the role of identity in transactions many transactions do not require identity. some such a crime reporting may in fact require anonymity. however many transactions do require identity: to determine if the necessary conditions for the transaction to occur exist to establish a relationship for repeated transactions or to tailor delivery of products and services. society requires identity systems to enable identity‐requiring transactions at scale putting methods in place that enable the formal asking and answering of identity queries at scale to allow many day‐to‐day transactions to occur. world economic forum ineffective identity systems create global challenges for people for businesses and for society as a whole reliance on legacy identity systems that do not effectively enable the transactions that people and entities wish to engage in create challenges for a wide set of stakeholders. for people for businesses for society service exclusion individuals are excluded from key services due to their inability to demonstrate identity poor user experience services provided to users do not match their needs or are delivered inconveniently information overexposure user information is overexposed putting users at risk of identity theft and privacy breach inefficient service delivery user‐facing processes are cumbersome resulting in poor customer experience service exclusion entities may be unable to prove attributes and therefore be excluded from key social structures lack of reliable information prevents businesses from accurately calculating the risk of doing obscure risk business fraud businesses suffer fraud resulting from stolen or incorrect customer information or poor authentication services are delivered incorrectly due to the lack service mismatch of information fraud entities can use false information or misrepresent information to gain illicit access to services process inefficiency processes are highly manual and paper‐based requiring human intervention and remediation proving identity involves many steps and processes provide out‐of‐date data or require process inefficiency checking multiple sources process inefficiency documents world economic forum these global identity challenges manifest as specific business problems for fis identity is critical to fis; their businesses are entirely transaction‐based involving transactions with a high degree of risk and require a high degree of certainty in completion. global problems with identity therefore manifest as specific business problems for fis. illustrative: business problems in financial services business problem retail / small‐ to medium‐ sized enterprise banking corporate and investment banking inefficient and costly onboarding processes inefficient costly and ineffective know‐your‐customer (kyc) and due diligence processes highly manual and time‐consuming compliance processes difficulty aggregating information on legal entities and determining total risk exposure difficulty attaching individual identity (e.g. corporate directors) to corporate identities difficulty identifying all transaction counterparties (e.g. third parties in trading relationships) difficulty complying with regulatory standards around data handling and privacy multiple views of the customer difficulty providing effective/suitable products and services lack of visibility into financial history for new customers high fraud rates difficulty tracking asset origination and ownership difficulty monitoring and tracking asset rehypothecation world economic forum many of these challenges are driven by the use of physical identity protocols to serve digital transactions today’s standard identity systems are based on physical documents and processes which creates many limitations. characteristics of physical identity systems document‐based: identity is based on physical records – the ability to prove identity depends on access and authentication to physical documents (e.g. passports id cards and records) siloed: identity information is held in discrete places that are not interconnected and do not enable aggregation which may be desired by the entity itself or required for some applications inflexible: identity is codified in documents as a limited and standardized set of information about an entity that cannot be easily adapted to transaction requirements the problems with physical identity • proof of identity that is based on possession of physical documents may not require demonstration of a link between an individual and the documents (i.e. authentication) enabling use of an entity’s credentials by a different user • physical identity documents can be falsified altered or tampered with as well as lost or stolen • physical attribute presentation and transfer create the potential for human error in transactions the identity shift identity is now at an inflection point; physical identity systems are breaking down and digital systems are emerging in response. physical identity digital identity physical identity was designed to enable face‐to‐face transactions among entities the digital economy is changing the way that identity transactions occur digital identity enables transactions in the digital world and offers improved functionality for its users world economic forum digital identity systems support the needs of today’s world digital identity systems emerged as a direct response to the requirements of transactions in the digital world. characteristics of digital identity systems digital‐based: identity exists as a set of digital records that the user can control and use to complete transactions interconnected: proof of identity can be communicated between entities in a standardized digital format flexible: identity systems adapt to the nature of the transaction and continuously adapt to requirements by integrating additional information to create a rich view of the user the promise of digital identity • digital information can be protected from damage tampering loss and theft with cutting‐edge authentication and security protocols • digital information can be shared in streamlined tailored and secure ways predicated on user consent institutions can better know and serve their customers improving existing products and offering new products and services to the underserved benefits digital identity would deliver a range of benefits to people businesses and society. privacy and control people would be able to control access to their information revenue growth financial institutions would have opportunities to offer identity‐as‐ a‐service improved compliance regulators would have increased access to trusted up‐to‐date information improved service delivery governments could more easily and effectively deliver public services world economic forum new and maturing technologies have important implications for the creation of robust digital identity systems these technologies may hold considerable promise for identity and are being explored by many different players. data storage new technologies may offer improved methods of storing user information and increasing user control privacy and security • distributed ledger technology combined with encryption and cloud storage allows information to be held and transferred point‐to‐point in a dispersed immutable network • federated identity standards such as saml 2.0 create interoperability between identity management networks and external applications allowing federated identity systems to scale to large numbers of identity providers and relying parties data transfer improved attribute exchange protocols allow information to be securely shared between endpoints without risk of interception or decryption and with more controls that create privacy for users improved encryption protocols such as keyless signature infrastructure on the blockchain and hashing provide strong protection for sensitive information and increase the reliability of digital activities • data transfer protocols such as attributed based credentials trust and zero‐knowledge proofs prevent the creation of metadata by concealing transaction endpoints increasing user privacy authentication many new techniques for authenticating users are being explored for their potential to increase information security and user control in certain circumstances by linking users to their digital activities in more robust and persistent ways • behavioural and contextual authentication incorporate human and environmental factors to authenticate a user or device • biometrics including fingerprint retina scanning heartbeat waveform and facial recognition based on mobile devices have potential to provide greater convenience and security and are being integrated into many anti‐fraud controls world economic forum digital identity systems have great potential but also many pitfalls in implementation many new identity systems are under development around the world in response to the need for digital identity and new technology capabilities. however not all have been successful illustrating some of the pitfalls inherent in the construction of identity systems. pitfalls in identity systems stakeholder rejection • users may not adopt the system due to poor design or distrust of the system’s purpose or structure • stakeholders may perceive systems with limited scope and scale as valueless and therefore not adopt them ineffective technology • a poor technology platform can reduce system functionality preventing user integration or transaction completion insufficient data protection results in breaches system compromise and data leakage limited support • systems that have support from a narrow set of interests may fail due to inconsistent efforts behind their construction and operation • systems that lack support from all key stakeholders may not experience sustainable and continuous uptake unsustainable operation • systems with unsustainable operating or business models will fail policy changes • large complex and emotive programmes such as id cards can be susceptible to political and / or ideological shifts world economic forum examples of identity system challenges are common… hack brief: turkey breach spills info on more than  half its citizens -wired  april 2016 philippine

information that describe an entity identity is not a monolith; it is a collection of individual attributes that describe an entity and determine the transactions in which that entity can participate. while the total existing set of attributes is endless they can be broadly categorized into three groups: inherent inherited and assigned attributes. these attributes differ for members of three main user groups: individuals legal entities and assets. for individuals: for legal entities: for assets: inherent attributes attributes that are intrinsic to an entity and are not defined by relationships to external entities. • age • height • date of birth • fingerprints industry • business status • nature of the asset • asset issuer accumulated attributes attributes that are gathered or developed over time. these attributes may change multiple times or evolve throughout an entity’s lifespan. • health records • preferences and behaviours (e.g. telephone metadata) assigned attributes attributes that are attached to the entity but are not related to its intrinsic nature. these attributes can change and generally are reflective of relationships that the entity holds with other bodies. world economic forum • national identifier number • telephone number • email address • business record • legal record • ownership history • transaction history identifying numbers • legal jurisdiction • directors identifying numbers • custodianship specific attributes enable entities to complete certain transactions identity is the total set of an entity’s attributes. these attributes enable entities to participate in transactions by proving to their counterparty that they have the specific attributes required for that transaction. example: users and transactions individuals legal entities assets to purchase alcohol users must prove that they are over the legal drinking age in that jurisdiction to onboard with a fi the entity must have proof that it is a legal and non‐ sanctioned entity asset trading such as trading of equities on a stock exchange requires proof of ownership and origination to vote users must prove that they are over the legal voting age have citizenship and reside in that jurisdiction to transact in capital markets the entity must have proof that it is a legal and non‐sanctioned entity with an acceptable risk profile transfer of title of an asset requires proof of ownership from the entity that is transferring the asset to open a bank account users must prove that they are a non‐sanctioned person who is legally allowed to engage in financial transactions note: assets have identity but are unable to act or transact on their own. assets require custodians who are entitled to act or transact on the asset's behalf. world economic forum identity transactions have three main aspects authorization attributes authentication what must be true about the users to complete the desired transaction? authorization is a function of the transaction and the transaction counterparty; they will determine the requirements for transaction eligibility and make a query about certain user attributes (e.g. age address). repeated identity transactions can users prove that they are eligible to complete this transaction? users must present their proof of attributes in response to the query. once users present the required attributes the counterparty must determine if they are reliable. do the attributes being presented genuinely belong to the entity that is presenting them? the counterparty will determine whether the attributes match the presenting users. if the users are able to authenticate the attributes the transaction can proceed. this model of identity transaction applies to onboarding transactions that is transactions where the counterparties do not have an established relationship or where the counterparty is required to gather identity information with every transaction. some identity relationships may have a single onboarding transaction; after initially onboarding the users and verifying them through a full identity transaction the counterparty may use an authentication method (e.g. username and password chip‐and‐pin card) for each subsequent transaction. this allows them to verify that the same entity is transacting each time without going through the full identity transaction process. note: not all transactions require exact knowledge of attributes. many transactions simply require attribute data to fall inside certain parameters (e.g. instead of knowing an individual’s birthdate a transaction may only require that the user be over a certain age); this is critical in constructing privacy‐enhancing identity systems. world economic forum different identity transactions require different levels of assurance the level of assurance (loa) in an identity transaction is the degree of certainty that the transacting parties have in the veracity of the identity being presented. assurance in transactions a high loa in identity transactions is not always desirable as a high loa requires intensive onboarding and strong authentication processes that may be cumbersome for the user. the loa required in an identity transaction should therefore generally be dependent on risk – the risk level of the transaction and the consequences of error. determing assurance levels the level of assurance of a given transaction is determined by two main factors: 1. registration protocols: how stringently the identity provider verifies attributes when onboarding users 2. authentication method: the strength of the authentication method used to complete transactions between the identity provider and the relying party low assurance transactions high assurance transactions transactions that do not involve a release of information and only involve an information flow from the user to the relying party are low‐assurance transactions examples include online registrations (e.g. signing up for a news site) and some payments (e.g. paying a parking ticket online) transactions that involve the release of sensitive and private information or the transfer of money or assets are high‐ assurance transactions examples include banking and other financial transactions such as using an online brokerage account and many government services world economic forum identity systems tend to evolve inside natural boundaries… identity exists within networks that enable transactions between the entities inside that network. these networks tend to evolve around user groups with similar needs and characteristics. these boundaries form what are called “natural identity networks”. every natural identity network has different needs and therefore will require different system configurations. natural identity networks the networks that form inside the natural boundaries of identity systems for individuals are based on geographic location or affiliations with a supervisory entity the networks that form inside the natural boundaries of identity systems for legal entities are based on national affiliation industry or geographic reach examples include national identity systems state or provincial identity systems and employee management systems world economic forum examples include national or global business registries and industry identifier systems the networks that form inside the natural boundaries of identity systems for assets are based on their asset class origination or ownership examples include registries of assets of a single class or registries of assets that are all owned by a single entity … and operate on a basic shared structure the purpose of a formal identity system is to allow counterparties without a previously established relationship to engage in trusted transactions. in a formal identity system the users’ attributes are attested to by trusted third parties; these third parties issue credentials that tie their attestation to the specific attributes with some method of authenticating the credential to the entity that is presenting it • users can use their wallet of credentials to engage in transactions with other entities that require some proof or knowledge of their attributes the structure of identity systems the user presents a set of attributes to a third party lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum the third party verifies the attributes and attaches its attestation to the attributes becoming an identity provider for the user the user then uses the credential from the identity provider in transactions with relying parties lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum world economic forum certain roles and functions must exist in every identity system every identity system must have four roles and one function to operate. users users are entities for which the system provides identity for the purpose of allowing them to engage in transactions identity providers identity providers (idps) are entities that hold user attributes attest to their veracity and complete identity transactions on behalf of users relying parties relying parties (rps) are entities that accept attestations from identity providers about user identity to allow users to access their services governance body governance body the governance body provides the governance body provides oversight for the system and owns oversight for the system and owns the operating standards and the operating standards and requirements requirements attribute exchange platform the attribute exchange platform completes transactions by matching identity queries from rps with attributes from idps and exchanging attributes or proof of identity world economic forum role function methods have evolved but the concept of identity proofing has not changed over time the fundamental concept purpose and structure of identity systems have not changed over time while methods and technology have made huge strides forward. past present a letter of introduction is one of the oldest forms of identity documentation. • user: individuals would use a letter of introduction as an attestation of identity and character to someone they did not know idp: the letter writers would provide attestations for various attributes of the users (e.g. that the user was a person of good character) • rp: the recipients of the letter would choose whether or not to accept the attestations based on their knowledge of the idp and their evaluation of the letter’s veracity today a passport issued by an individual’s country of residence or origin is one of the most common trusted identity documents. • user: individuals are often asked to present their passport to complete transactions that require proof of identity (e.g. entering new countries opening a bank account etc.) idp: the government of that country acts as an idp making certain attestations about the user • rp: the attestations made by the idp are accepted by a rp based on its trust in the document its issuer and its evaluation of whether the bearer is the true owner of the passport world economic forum digital identity allows identity transactions to be completed through digital channels a digital identity system has the same basic structure as a physical identity system but attribute storage and exchange are entirely digital removing reliance on physical documents and manual processes. features of digital identity systems digital information storage and transfer • user identity information is captured and stored in digital form • user identity information is transferred between idps and rps in digital form • form factors such as computer or mobile devices rather than physical documents can be used to complete transactions direct connectivity information transfer occurs directly between idps and rps without an intermediary (although user consent can be built in) and without manual intervention (e.g. physical information entry) the current landscape of digital identity digital identity is not a new concept; many identity systems exist in the world today that either incorporate some digital elements or are entirely digital‐based systems. the landscape of digital identity solutions is explored further in the next section of this report. these systems exist along a spectrum of maturity and degree of sophistication; however all are designed to capture some of the benefits that digital identity brings over traditional physical‐based identity systems. world economic forum digital identity offers significant benefits over physical identity systems beyond offering new functionality digital identity has significant functional benefits over physical‐based identity systems. security  physical identity documents can easily be lost stolen or replicated by illicit actors as well as read by entities with no legitimate reason to have the user information  digital identity information could be stored transferred and exposed using cutting‐edge digital security protocols that would prevent against data breach modification loss and theft privacy and control  physical identity does not allow the release of information to be tailored to the identity transaction; identity documents display a fixed set of information that can be read by almost any entity  digital identity allows individuals to control the sharing of their information to expose the minimum amount of information required for a given transaction and shield their information from illicit access user experience  physical identity requires users to manually show documents or enter identity information in transactions resulting in a cumbersome user experience and creating potential for human error in transactions  digital information transfer would streamline the transaction process for users and rps across all channels increasing the ease of transacting for both parties and removing the potential for human error flexibility  physical identity results in the crystallization of user identity in physical documents and a fixed view of identity that cannot  digital identity would provide a flexible and scalable system that could incorporate a greater richness of identity be expanded to cover additional user attributes information than is currently possible world economic forum the landscape of digital  identity systems many digital identity systems exist in the world today serving various natural networks the digital identity systems that exist today fall across broad ranges of purpose scope and sophistication. some systems have a digital element bolted onto what is still fundamentally a physical identity system while others are fully digital and are built to scale and expand as user needs evolve. disparate identity systems were studied including systems for all user groups to understand the landscape of digital identity solutions categorize these systems and draw high‐level conclusions on which systems best suit different needs. types of digital identity systems systems for individuals the majority of identity systems are designed for individuals and are often government‐driven systems purpose: designed to increase financial or social inclusion and streamline the delivery of services or to control access to internal systems for a single organization systems for legal entities identity systems for legal entities often take the form of centralized registries of information that are owned by a single government or utility systems for assets identity systems for assets often take the form of a centralized registry or an internal system for a single organization purpose: intended to standardize data across entities streamline processes and enable data aggregation at a macro level purpose: intended to clarify ownership standardize data or enable the operation of networked systems world economic forum the most significant differences in identity systems fall across three primary dimensions primary dimensions of choice are the set of choices that must be made in the design of a digital identity system that have the greatest impact on the system’s function and structure. these are not always conscious choices; they are often a natural outcome of the setting in which the system is being implemented and the problem that the system is intended to solve or the needs that it is intended to serve. the three primary dimensions of choice are: nature of identity provision is there a single source of identity information? are there a limited set of parties who provide attributes? is identity provision distributed across many different entities? number of relying parties nature of information transfer is there a single rp that can access user attributes or are there many rps that can access user information? is information transferred from the idp to the rp for the purpose of authenticating a user or is there a transfer of user attributes that the rp requires to execute a given transaction? centralized: one entity stores and provides the identity information federated: a limited number of entities store and provide identity information distributed: many different entities store and provide identity information one: the system has a single rp that is able to access identity information many: the system incorporates many rps that are able to access identity information authentication: the idp authenticates the user for the rp allowing the rp to complete transactions using information or records that the rp holds transaction: the rp requires information from the idp for the purposes of completing a transaction for the user world economic forum world economic forum we have defined five distinct archetypes that exhibit significant differences in structure and purpose internal identity management external authentication centralized identity federated authentication distributed identity e r u t c u r t s one entity acts as both the idp and rp many idps authenticate users to a single rp one idp serves many rps the system has a single idp that authenticates users and transfers or exposes attributes to many different rps the system provides users within a single network access to services that they are permissioned to access based on their attributes • all user attributes are held inside the single entity and are used to permission users to either grant or deny access to a given service or pathway the system authenticates users to the rp based on their authentication to one of a set of idps • no attributes are transferred between the idps and the rp; the authentication transaction is used to simply grant or deny the user access to the services offered by the rp a set number of idps authenticate users to many rps the system has a single idp that stores user information while a separate set of idps authenticate users who are attempting to transact with rps • after authentication the requested attributes are transferred from the idp that holds attributes to the rp with which the user is transacting many idps serve many different rps the system involves multiple idps that authenticate users and transfer attributes to many different rps n o i t a m r o f n i f o w o l f world economic forum identity provider (idp) relying party (rp) attribute flow authentication flow internal identity management solutions are designed for use by one entity internal identity management in internal identity management systems the same entity acts as an idp and a rp. the entity uses information that it holds on users to permission them to access various internal services. a good example of an internal identity management system would be a company or a government that permissions its employees or citizens to access different services based on their attributes. key archetype features • the idp/rp owns the required attributes needed to determine user permissions within the organization • the system is used to control which users within a single organization or entity have permission to access certain services • these types of solutions are generally developed by private organizations and sold as a product or service to various entities and institutions case studies closed internal management systems private solutions global leading software as a solution (saas) providers such as salesforce oracle sap and microsoft provide solutions that help their customers better understand manage and interact with a set of users. saas has become a common delivery model for many business as these solutions help keep users data and applications within a closed system secure. these solutions serve a variety of industries and user groups (e.g. customers employees citizens etc.). world economic forum external authentication systems facilitate access to high‐traffic services external authentication in external authentication systems one entity acts as both the idp and the rp but uses an additional external set of idps to authenticate its users. the purpose of this system is to improve user experience for individuals or businesses when accessing online services; these users can use existing logins rather than maintaining multiple usernames and passwords for each service. key archetype features • the system has one rp often a government that holds user information and leverages a set of established institutions as idps (e.g. fis telecom providers) • the idps are usually trusted entities that perform strong authentication in user onboarding and are therefore trusted to provide a high level of assurance in identity transactions • users can use their existing authentication methods through this group of idps to gain access to the rp’s services • both the rp and idps store user attributes – the authentication system is used to verify that the entity authenticating through the idp should be permitted to transact with the rp • no attributes are transferred from idps to the rp case studies gov.uk verify public‐private programme united kingdom the gov.uk verify programme is an external authentication system that allows uk citizens to access government services online. users verify their identity online with one of nine idps. once the users are authenticated through one of these providers they are granted access to the government service they are trying to access. securekey concierge public‐private solution canada securekey concierge is a digital authentication system that allows individuals to choose a trusted credential they already have with one of a set of fis to access government services online. the users log in with their online banking username and password and are authenticated by their bank. once authenticated the users are granted access to the service. no attributes are transferred in the system. world economic forum centralized identity systems use one idp as a single source of truth centralized identity in centralized identity systems a single entity acts as an idp that authenticates users to rps and transfers their attributes. these systems are often designed to streamline service delivery enable data aggregation and provide a single view of users across multiple rps. key archetype features • a single idp holds all user attributes and owns the identity system; this is often the government or another central governing body • the idp authenticates the user to the rp and transfers either a fixed or a tailored set of attributes to the rp to enable it to complete a transaction on behalf of the user • some systems require rps to pay a fee to use the system and to gain access to user attributes identity information can be transferred directly through a physical form factor (e.g. a smart card) or through a digital brokerage system case studies digid government programme netherlands digid is a digital authentication system for dutch residents who are accessing government services online. individual attributes are held in a national citizen registry; these attributes are used to authenticate users when they apply for a digid. individuals can then use their digid username and password to authenticate themselves to government agencies. their national identifier number is transferred from the national citizen registry to the rp. population registry government programme finland the population registry is a national database that is owned and maintained by the finnish government. the government acts as the idp transferring attributes to public and private rps. the purpose of the system is to collect data that can be used for elections tax filing judicial administration etc. private rps may also access this data if they pay a fee and have received user consent. world economic forum federated authentication systems rely on third parties to grant user access to services federated authentication in federated authentication systems one idp uses a set of third parties to authenticate users to a range of rps. the primary idp is the entity that stores and transfers user attributes. these systems are designed to improve the login and transaction processes for users who are accessing online services by allowing them to use a single set of credentials to authenticate and transferring attributes to rps on their behalf. key archetype features • a set of third‐party idps act as brokers that authenticate users to the rps identity information is stored centrally by one idp with which they are attempting to transact • rps are able to access user attributes from the primary idp often for a fee; many systems also require explicit user consent for attributes to be transferred in systems that allow for the discretionary transfer of attributes rather than a fixed set of attributes the user must explicitly consent to the transfer of specified attributes from the primary idp to the rp • these systems are often government‐driven and the government acts as the central idp that holds citizen or entity data case studies nemid private sector solution denmark nemid is an electronic id digital signature and secure email solution that provides individuals access to public and private services. the government tendered the system to the private sector. users use a common nemid login and password as well as unique one‐time passwords to authenticate themselves to online services. user attributes are stored in a central registry. sweden bankid public‐private service sweden sweden has established an eid system that provides citizens and businesses access to over public and private services. digital identities are issued by a set of private entities including large banks and a major telecommunications provider. the public sector buys identity validation services from the private sector. private sector service providers can join the bankid system by signing contracts with eid providers for authentication. the solution has been very successful; over million citizens currently use the service. world economic forum distributed identity systems connect many idps and rps distributed identity in distributed identity systems many idps collect store and transfer user attributes to many rps. these systems are notable in that they do not rely on attributes from a single idp. the purpose of these systems is to allow users to interact easily with many different entities in an online environment by giving them a digital “wallet” of credentials. key archetype features identity information may be stored by multiple idps on a distributed protocol (e.g. blockchain) or may be collected from a variety of sources and aggregated by a single entity that operates the system • attributes can be transferred from idps to rps through a variety of methods including smart cards or digital/mobile protocols • these systems are often privately owned and funded; governments or other public sector bodies may not play an active role within the network • users own their own identities and often control which transactions occur and what attributes are transferred from one or more idps to the rp • these systems may not have a governance body and instead rely on common operating standards for interoperability world economic forum case studies tupas private sector solution finland tupas is an identity system in which over banks act as idps. individuals can log into a wide range of services with credentials from their bank. the users’ full names and national id numbers are transferred from the idp to the rp. global legal entity identifier foundation (gleif) non‐profit organization global gleif supports the implementation of the legal entity identifier (lei) standard. this system assigns leis to every entity that engages with fis; entities can use their counterparty’s lei to access their identity information from the gleif’s partner network. mobile connect gsma global mobile connect is a digital identity system that authenticates the users through their device  allowing users to access a variety of services. this eliminates the need for users to have many usernames and passwords to access online services. the potential of blockchain technology in identity blockchain or distributed ledger technology (dlt) is a technology protocol that allows data to be shared directly between entities in a network without intermediaries. dlt has certain key features that hold potential for identity systems: features of distributed ledger technology low transaction cost distributed ledgers eliminate the need for intermediaries and therefore lower the cost of completing transactions immutability transaction history is maintained and verified through the network preventing the falsification of information convenience record‐keeping and transactions can be executed from any device on‐ or offline illustrative: applications of dlt in digital identity dlt has potential in identity applications as an information storage and transfer mechanism within different archetypes. dlt could be applied as a distributed protocol giving users the ability to store their identity attestations on a ledger and expose them to different rps or in a centralized system where the ledger would be owned by a single entity that would provide a consolidated view of the users’ attestations for use in transactions but would not reveal the nature of the credentials. many initiatives are currently underway that explore the true potential for dlt in identity systems; this report will not explore this topic in detail. world economic forum the right solution for the  right problem the archetypes of digital identity are built to serve very different needs internal identity management best suited to: manage user permissions inside a single entity based on internal information to ensure the right individuals have access to the right resources and endpoints example: large organizations that need an identity access and management solution to control access to their internal services with a select user group (e.g. employees customers etc.) external authentication best suited to: streamline user access to a suite of services that are offered by a single entity and eliminate proprietary logins example: a government offering its citizens online services that are critical but infrequently used centralized identity best suited to: provide a single version of the truth and a complete accurate and standardized view of non‐confidential data across different users example: an industry utility offering a comprehensive view of the entities in that industry to manage risk and exposure federated authentication best suited to: provide a single version of the truth and a complete accurate and standardized view of data while allowing users to authenticate to a set of third parties thereby eliminating proprietary logins example: a government enabling identity transactions for its citizens through collaboration with third parties distributed identity best suited to: incorporate large numbers of idps and rps providing user convenience control and privacy in an online environment example: a full digital economy requiring multiple independent connections between idps and rps to enable user transactions world economic forum two of these archetypes are well suited to solve broad identity problems centralized and distributed identity systems are best suited to provide digital identity at scale; however these two archetypes are not equally well suited to provide identity for different user groups. for individuals for legal entities and assets distributed identity centralized identity distributed identity systems are the best fit to provide identity for individuals at large scale • distributed identity systems are built to scale to large numbers of idps and rps enabling a full set of convenient and efficient transactions for users • these systems protect user privacy and increase control by allowing users to choose which entities hold their information and by removing a single point of failure from the system centralized identity systems are suitable to provide identity for legal entities and assets on a large scale • centralized identity systems offer a consolidated and standardized view of identity information and offer the single source of truth that is required for transactions involving legal entities and assets to deliver key value to external stakeholders such as regulators distributed identity distributed identity systems are also suited to provide identity for legal entities and assets on a large scale; however these identity systems should have a “wallet” or aggregation layer that can provide a consolidated view of the user • distributed identity solutions offer identity at scale and an aggregation layer provides the single view of the user required for legal entities and assets world economic forum the centralized and distributed identity archetypes would also solve many of the business challenges that fis are currently experiencing in retail / small‐ to medium‐sized enterprise banking the need: • trusted up‐to‐date individual identity information • ability to access additional user attributes with consent • ability to internally link identity information to provide a single view of the customer • secure repositories for user information to prevent identity theft due to stolen data in corporate and investment banking the need: • trusted up‐to‐date user identity information • visibility into asset and user identity information • ability to link asset entity identity and individual information • ability to aggregate identity information across entities distributed identity distributed identity for individuals would allow fis to access trusted user information and link it back to a single user identity; it would also ensure that user information would be securely stored with redundancy in the case of breach. centralized identity distributed identity centralized identity and distributed identity with an aggregation layer for legal entities and assets would allow fis to have a consolidated trusted source of digital attributes for these users. world economic forum configuring and implementing an identity system require many additional choices beyond archetype selection configuring an identity system requires choices to be made against a secondary set of dimensions that do not have the key functional and structural importance of the primary dimensions but have strong impact on how the system will operate. the choices made against the secondary dimensions should therefore be tailored to suit the specific needs and requirements of the natural identity network. illustrative: secondary dimensions of choice types of idps and rps: what types of entities are allowed to act as idps and rps in the identity system? broker mechanism: how are rp queries connected with idp attestations? can the system support attribute exposure and attribute inquiry transactions? does the system support transaction blinding? data management: where are data stored ‐ in a central database on a smart card on a distributed protocol (e.g. blockchain)? are user attributes aggregated by a third party? scaling: is the system designed to scale beyond its initial set of applications? business model: what is the business model that supports the system? who funds the system? governance: who is responsible for system governance and oversight? who is responsible for system operation? user rights: what level of control do users have over the information that is held on the system who holds it and when and how it is shared? note: this is not an exhaustive list of choices; many further choices must be made it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list of the secondary dimensions of choice in the configuration and implementation of an identity system or to give recommendations against each. a set of guiding principles has therefore been developed to steer secondary decision‐making and to assist in delivering a robust identity system that suits the needs of its stakeholders. world economic forum guiding principles the guiding principles shape the choices that need to be made against the secondary set of dimensions a successful natural identity network is a product of the choices made against the secondary dimensions. five principles inform decision‐ making around these choices and guide the development of robust value‐accretive systems. guiding principles for digital identity social good the system is designed as a social good that is available to all users and will deliver maximum benefit to a range of stakeholders privacy‐enhancing user information is only exposed to the right entities under the right circumstances user‐centric users have control over their information and can determine who holds and accesses it viable and sustainable the system is sustainable as a business and is resilient to shifting political priorities open and flexible the system is built on open standards to allow scaling and development; standards and guidelines are transparent to stakeholders world economic forum identity systems should provide identity to all users serve user interests and be accessible to all entities that wish to transact within them social good background the ability to prove identity allows users to be integrated into formal financial and social systems and engage in necessary and basic day‐to‐day transactions; digital identity should therefore be considered a social good to which all entities should have access. implications • the system should be designed to scale to all users and network stakeholders who wish to participate • the public sector should have some involvement in defining the system’s operating parameters and regulatory standards to ensure user interests are protected and to increase the scale of the system • system access mechanisms (e.g. mobile platforms) should democratize access implications for fis • fis have relationships with a large numbers of users; this scale can act as a catalyst in driving system adoption and uptake • fis have a key role to play in ensuring that identity systems are a tool to increase financial inclusion case studies sassa public‐private partnership south africa the south african social security agency grindrod bank and mastercard have issued biometric enabled debit cards to over million social security recipients. the sassa card holds an individual’s personal information on the chip is authenticated through biometrics (fingerprint and voice pattern) or a personal identification number (pin) and is linked directly to a bank account where social grants are deposited. the end result is over million people becoming financially included and huge efficiencies in the distribution of social grants in south africa. world economic forum identity systems should be privacy‐enhancing  protecting user information from illegitimate access accidental exposure and overexposure privacy‐enhancing background current identity systems put users at risk leaving user information vulnerable to privacy infringement data leakage and overexposure. a digital identity system should protect user information ensuring that only what is needed is revealed to rps and that these parties are only using the data for the disclosed purposes. implications • all attributes including demonstrated behaviour and preferences should be covered in an identity system • attribute transfer should use new information exchange protocols that allow endpoint blinding • the brokerage mechanism that connects the endpoints of identity queries should allow only the minimum required information to complete attribute inquiry or attribute exposure transactions to be exposed to the rp • attributes should only be stored by idps with adequate data security (as defined by system standards) • users or custodians should have visibility into requested identity transactions and a defined recourse method if their information is being misused • the storage of sensitive information should be non‐centralized to reduce the severity of consequences and the impact on users in the event of a data breach implications for fis • fis should build cyber‐resilient identity systems and meet standards set by the governance body around data protection and storage • fis will need to seek user consent to gain access to or share attributes case studies tupas private identity solution finland in the finnish tupas system a set of fis act as idps and transfer user information on their behalf to rps. the user has visibility into which attributes are being requested by the rp and must provide consent for the exchange to occur drivers’ licences government solutions global traditional drivers’ licences are a commonly used form of identity. however they compromise privacy by permitting the rp to read all the user’s information rather than just the information required for the transaction. world economic forum identity systems should give users control over the storage and transfer of their personal information user‐centric background many identity systems have failed due to a lack of user uptake driven by concerns around the function and purposes of these systems. a successful digital identity system that serves as a social good should place the user (or the user’s custodians) in control over identity information. implications • the mutuality of identity should be considered; users or custodians must have clear visibility into who is requesting their information and for what purpose identity transactions should require consent; exceptions must be clearly defined and communicated and users should be advised of when their information has been accessed • users should be able to revoke consent • users should have control over where their personal information is stored • users should be able to easily update their information with idps implications for fis • fis will be able to request identity information from users in order to tailor products and services • fis will require user consent to share identity information case studies consensys private solution usa in the consensys system users are able to upload their information and have complete control over who their data are exposed to. users do not choose who stores their data because all identity information is stored on uport – a user‐controlled application that operates on the blockchain. securekey concierge public‐private solution canada the securekey concierge system allows canadian citizens to access government services online by authenticating through any of a large number of fis with which they already transact. world economic forum identity systems should be designed as businesses that are viable and sustainable in the long term viable and sustainable background implementing a digital identity system represents a significant effort for all stakeholders; stakeholders must have assurance that their investment will be worthwhile. the system must therefore be designed as a viable and sustainable project. implications • the public sector should have some role in system development and implementation to represent user interest to drive uptake and to ensure regulatory participation • the private sector should be involved in system development and implementation to provide executional ability and operational viability and ensure the system is cost‐effective • both the public and private sectors should play a role in developing operational standards including: – liability and dispute resolution – business model – information collection storage and transfer – levels of assurance – technical requirements – user consent models – auditing implications for fis • fis have a key role to play as important and trusted private entities in shaping the system’s operational requirements and standards • fis will have the opportunity to monetize identity‐as‐a‐service world economic forum case studies national id cards government solution united kingdom the uk government introduced national id cards as a personal identification document. the system was scrapped in january as the incoming government stated the system was “wasteful bureaucratic and intrusive” posing a significant threat to the privacy and security of personal information. clarient entity hub dtcc private identity solution global clarient entity hub is a utility designed to manage data and regulatory complexity for parties engaging in financial transactions. it aims to increase transparency across financial markets and is offered as a paid service to other entities. identity systems should be built on open technology and data standards and should be designed to integrate new parties and serve changing user needs open and flexible background identity systems that are static and designed for a single purpose are by nature limited in scope and have low resilience to environmental changes. a resilient identity system should accommodate changing requirements and integrate new parties. implications • the system must be built on open technology standards • the system must be built on open data standards • the system must have clear standards around idps and rps such that new entities can join the system and adhere to all standards and requirements • the system must have a governance body that will continuously adapt requirements and standards and monitor system performance implications for fis • open technology and data standards will reduce barriers to users switching institutions case studies x‐road government solution estonia the estonian digital identity system is built on a common technology framework called x‐ road. this framework creates interoperability between different databases hugely increasing the digital identity system’s functionality and effectiveness. european union e‐identity legislation public sector solution eu‐wide the eu e‐identity legislation sets requirements for member states issuing identity to citizens to ensure mutual recognition and scale of identity systems across europe. world economic forum the established implications should help guide decision‐making around configuring identity systems building a successful identity network is difficult. a series of choices need to be made to ensure the system delivers value to all stakeholders and gains traction and acceptance. • the highest‐level considerations in the development of an identity system are the user group and the need that the system will serve and the archetype structure that should therefore be considered. • once these considerations have been settled the secondary dimensions of choice should be considered against the guiding principles of digital identity. problems and user groups primary dimensions of choice secondary dimensions of choice the highest consideration is the user group and the problem that the identity system is designed to solve; this will determine the limits of the natural identity network the user group and target problem will guide the selection of an appropriate identity archetype the guiding principles for identity and their implications will help determine what structural and configuration choices should be made against the secondary dimensions of choice world economic forum these implications are meaningful for entities within the digital identity network when configuring identity systems stakeholders will have a set of decisions to make at each stage of the process. illustrative: some open questions for identity stakeholders 1. problems and user groups • which user group does this system serve? what problems will the system solve? • what unique characteristics will affect this user group’s acceptance and use of an identity system? • which archetype is best suited to solve this problem? 2. primary dimensions of choice • which entities should act as idps in this system? • what type of rps should be included in this system? • what type of information must be transferred in the system? 3. secondary dimensions of choice should the system use an identity‐as‐a‐service fee‐for‐transaction business model? • what technology standard and trust framework will the system use? • what assurance model will the system use? • how will the governance body be organized? what entities will be involved in system governance? • how will the user give consent in transactions? • will any exceptions to user consent requirements be allowed? • how will the public sector be engaged in shaping the operational standards? world economic forum benefits the implementation of digital identity networks would benefit a set of different stakeholder groups identity systems that are constructed based on this guidance will deliver benefits both to the stakeholders involved directly in the identity network and to external stakeholders. fis specifically would accrue deep benefit as a result of the implementation of digital identity. stakeholder groups b identity providers c relying parties a users spotlight on: financial institutions

exposed improved products and services idps can use detailed and trusted customer information to deliver tailored services decreased risk and liability rps understand their liability in the event of data loss or breach service provision rps can differentiate between illicit and legitimate users what benefits would accrue to users? users 1. privacy and control • users would have full control over which idps hold their attributes • users consent would be required before idps could expose attributes to rps • user data would not be sold by third parties • the minimum amount of user information required would be transferred during transactions privacy and control 2. security • user attributes would only be held by entities meeting system standards and requirements for information handling and storage • digital attribute storage would make identity information resistant to damage destruction or loss • users would have the ability to disperse their identity information creating  contingency if an idp suffered a data breach or data were erased or stolen and reducing the impact of a data breach on the user 3. convenience • digital identity and digital attribute transfer would simplify and improve the user experience in transactions eliminating the need for users to track multiple authentication methods (e.g. usernames and passwords) and manually submit personal information during transactions • attributes would be transferred digitally removing the potential for human error and subsequent information remediation • users would be able to easily update information held with their idps and would not have to deal with transactions being executed based on inaccurate or out‐of‐date information 4. transparency • users would have visibility into which attributes would be exposed and to what entity during identity transactions security convenience transparency world economic forum what benefits would accrue to users? users: case study estonia’s e‐government system protects citizen information provides an extremely convenient experience for users and allows them to feel ownership over their data. e‐government government solution estonia • the government of estonia has created a digital interface between citizens and government agencies. the government holds citizen information in a centralized population registry and acts as the idp and governing body transferring reliable and trusted data to rps. • citizens are each assigned an eid identifier that they can use to log on to the state portal which provides access to dozens of services from voting to updating automobile registries to applying to universities. the government transfers the attribute information needed to complete each transaction from the population registry to the rp and citizens are able to see what entities have accessed their information. • citizens of estonia have the ability to view who has accessed their records how often and for what purpose. this transparency allows citizens to feel ownership over their data as they are able to see how the information is being used. • a compelling example is the electronic health record – a nationwide system that integrates data from various healthcare providers into a single portal. users are able to log on to a patient portal to control their treatment and manage their healthcare information. chekk allows users to own manage and share their personal information chekk private sector solution global • chekk is a mobile solution that provides users with a secure wallet of their personal attributes and allows them to share up‐to‐date information with the entities with which they transact. in the chekk system only the information required for a transaction is supplied meaning that the user is in control and their privacy is protected. world economic forum what benefits would accrue to idps? identity providers 1. revenue growth idps would complete identity transactions for rps; this would allow them to monetize identity‐as‐a‐service through per‐transaction fees or other business models 2. defined risk and liability • liability guidelines would be clearly defined and communicated; idps would be clear about their liability in the event of data loss or breach or contravention of the standards for identity provision 3. competitive positioning idps would be able to forge a strong relationship with users and position themselves as a critical part of the digital economy given their unique insight into users and their established position of trust 4. improved products and services idps would have increased access to detailed and reliable user information that would allow them to better tailor processes products and services idps could begin to draw on non‐standard user attributes to better manage and evaluate risk (e.g. health records) • secure digital identity protocols and digital attribute transfer would improve user experience and expand the number of services that idps could securely provide online revenue growth defined risk and liability competitive positioning improved products and services world economic forum what benefits would accrue to idps? identity providers: case study a set of banks act as idps in the tupas system providing individuals with access to over public and private services. tupas private sector solution finland • the federation of finnish financial services drove the creation of a bank identity system called tupas designed to improve user access to online services. • the rps pay for the service (initiation fees monthly fees and fees for set transaction volumes). users may also be charged on a monthly basis depending on their relationship with their bank. • while a group of telecoms in finland offer a competing service as of february 95% of all online service logins were processed through tupas. only 2% of online service logins were processed through the competing system. this may be due to the government’s strong adoption of tupas citizen loyalty towards government and banks or the fact that it was the first successful service in the region. tupas has established a new revenue stream for banks as well as a strong competitive position. • with most banks the user must approve and certify that the data being transferred from the bank to the rp are accurate eliminating any liability risk for the idp. world economic forum what benefits would accrue to rps? relying parties 1. information accuracy • rps would have access to trusted verified identity information matched to the level of assurance required for their products or services; this would eliminate the need for information remediation and for information cross‐checks through paid third‐party services • digital attribute exchange would eliminate the potential for human error in transactions information accuracy 2. service tailoring • rps would be able to provide more tailored products and services to users by requesting access to identity information beyond what they would traditionally require to complete transactions 3. service provision • more reliable and accurate identity protocols would give rps greater ability to differentiate between illicit and legitimate users and to deny or provide services accordingly 4. decreased transaction abandonment • a more streamlined user experience would remove barriers to completing transactions (e.g. forgotten login information required account creation rejected billing information) and would therefore reduce the rates of users’ transaction abandonment 5. decreased risk and liability • liability guidelines would be clearly defined and communicated; rps would be clear about their liability in the event of data loss or breach or contravention of the standards for identity provision service tailoring service provision decreased transaction abandonment decreased risk and liability world economic forum what benefits would accrue to rps? relying parties: case study the population registry is a central database that stores identity information – the data are trusted by many entities in finland as a comprehensive source of up‐to‐date information about citizens assets and legal entities. population registry government programme finland the population registry is a national database owned and maintained by the finnish government. the government acts as the idp transferring attributes to public and private rps. citizens are required to provide up‐to‐date information to the population registry such that idps can trust that the information they are receiving is accurate. public rps that require attributes to complete transactions can use citizens’ national id numbers to access data held in the population registry. the necessary attributes are transferred digitally from the registry to the rp. private rps can also subscribe to the population registry and access information (with consent) to provide better products and services to their users. world economic forum what benefits would accrue to external stakeholders? external stakeholders are parties that are not involved in the system’s day‐to‐day operation but are key stakeholders in the system. the external stakeholders are governments and regulators. a governments b regulators process streamlining and efficiency governments can more efficiently interact with their citizens saving time and money tracing of assets

data collection and storage can be standardized across all fis for users improving the effectiveness of the overall compliance process reducing friction in data aggregation world economic forum what benefits would accrue to governments? governments 1. process streamlining and efficiency • governments would be able to more efficiently interact with their citizens saving time and money in the delivery of services such as tax filing and the distribution of social assistance 2. improved service delivery • governments would be able to leverage accurate identity information to more easily identify the individuals and entities that are eligible to access given services • governments would be able to easily identify and deliver services to those who might be financially or socially excluded due to the lack of traditional identity information process streamlining and efficiency improved service delivery world economic forum what benefits would accrue to governments? governments: case study the aadhaar programme was introduced in india to increase social and financial inclusion by providing identity for all indians residents many of whom previously had no means of proving their identities. aadhaar government programme india • the aadhaar card was developed to improve financial inclusion in the country. the unique identification authority of india (uidai) acts as the central idp controlling who has access to the data that they collect and store. • to receive a card individuals submit various documents to a local registrar. if they are unable to provide documentation an “introducer” such as an elected representative or a local teacher or doctor can vouch for the person's identity. this parallel process decreases the chance of uidai storing inaccurate information or providing social services to illegal immigrants or other illicit actors. the uidai has a database that holds information such as name date of birth and biometrics data that may include a photograph fingerprint iris scan or other information. • the aadhaar program has been very effective in increasing financial inclusion with over billion people enrolled for accounts however there are still some outstanding concerns about information protection and privacy. the estonian e‐residency program allows non‐estonian citizens to gain digital residency in the country. e‐residency government programme estonia • the e‐residency program allows non‐estonian citizens to get a digital id card that enables them to use estonian private and public services and to use secure digital signatures. the purpose of the program is to create a virtual business environment and continue to position estonia as a hub of the digital world • since its inception in december almost people have applied for e‐residency and over have established an new company domiciled in estonia. world economic forum what benefits would accrue to regulators? regulators tracing of assets transparent view of entities improved compliance data standardization 1. tracing of assets • regulators would be able to more effectively trace asset origination and ownership increasing their ability to track the proceeds of criminal activity • asset rehypothecation could be traced ensuring that assets would not be rehypothecated beyond their total value 2. transparent view of entities • regulators would have access to an aggregated view of legal entities across their hierarchies increasing their ability to evaluate systemic risk and manage stability 3. improved compliance • access to trusted identity information would increase the ability of fis to be compliant with anti‐money laundering know‐your‐customer and other regulations within their jurisdiction • access to trusted information on legal entity and asset identity would allow fis to more accurately detect money laundering and other suspicious transactions • access to trusted digital attributes would allow fis to automate their compliance processes to some degree potentially allowing regulators to increase the required frequency of compliance reviews 4. data standardization • data collection and storage could be standardized across all fis reducing friction in data aggregation world economic forum what benefits would accrue to regulators? regulators: case study gleif is an organization that supports the implementation of the legal entity identifier standard – this standard might ultimately become a common thread between identifier systems in an effort to create a standardized global view of legal entities. global legal entity identifier foundation (gleif) non‐profit organization global • gleif manages a network of local operating units that issue legal entity identifiers (leis) to legal entities worldwide. • legal entities engaging in financial transactions submit a standard set of attributes to a local operating unit which validates them against third‐party records and then issues an lei. gleif holds the master file of all leis and associated entity information. • the system was introduced by financial regulators to improve micro‐ and macro‐prudential risk assessment and management increase market transparency and improve the accuracy of financial data. • beyond financial services and regulation the goal of the lei system is to provide reliable identity information to permit unique identification of legal entities worldwide in financial services and beyond (e.g. supply chain applications). • over leis have been issued since october 2015. the lei is intended to become the link between all other identifier systems (e.g. know‐your‐customer systems business register codes etc.). this would allow regulators to have a consistent and comprehensive view of all legal entities and financial instruments globally. world economic forum fis have key features that would give them structural advantages within identity systems fis have unique advantages that make them well‐suited to playing key roles in digital identity networks. advantages of fis in digital identity fis are highly reliant on identity identity is central to the function of fis while they bear a large part of the cost of ineffective identity protocols fis are connected to many key identity stakeholders fis have standing relationships with users governments regulators and other key stakeholders and have experience working with these groups on key concerns while balancing competing interests fis are trusted institutions fis are more trusted by consumers to hold personal information than other institutions such as governments telecoms and technology companies fis have existing business models that do not require directly monetizing customer information world economic forum case studies idin private sector solution netherlands idin was created to capitalize on the large investments that banks have made in onboarding their customers; banks already collect highly trusted identity information and are well positioned to transfer it to other parties. nemid private sector solution denmark to maximize the adoption of nemid the governing body wanted to cooperate with private actors who have frequently used services; banks not only interact with individuals on a regular basis but are also seen as trusted institutions that already store user identity. securekey concierge public‐private programme canada securekey partnered with nine banks that are trusted and hold accurate data; this data can be used to authenticate individuals in the system. what benefits would accrue to fis from the implementation of digital identity? the benefits to fis of implementing digital identity fall into six categories: improved products and services fis will be able to use detailed and trusted customer information to deliver tailored services to customers financial institutions improved compliance digital attribute handling and greater access to user identity will allow fis to complete compliance processes more easily and accurately operational efficiency digital attribute transfer and handling will allow fis to streamline and automate many processes eliminating human error decreased fraud the secure digital storage of user information will reduce fraud resulting from stolen information or compromised authentication revenue growth fis will have the opportunity to increase revenue from improved products and services as well as to offer identity‐as‐a‐service better user experience and competitive positioning fis can offer a streamlined user experience and position themselves as a critical part of the digital economy world economic forum what benefits would accrue to fis from the implementation of digital identity? financial institutions 1. improved products and services • fis would have increased access to detailed and reliable user information that would allow them to better tailor processes products and services such as: – risk scoring for insurance products – financial advisory – asset management – credit scoring – loan adjudication improved products and services operational efficiency • fis could begin to draw on trusted information with consent to better manage and evaluate risk; secure digital identity protocols and digital attribute transfer would improve user experience and expand the number of services that fis could securely provide online 2. operational efficiency • fis would be able to access user information in a consolidated digital form through queries in the digital identity network; having attributes in a consolidated digital form would provide a single view of the customer and allow fis to streamline customer‐facing operations such as onboarding as well as many back‐end processes • digital identity for assets would allow fis to track financial products and assets more closely through greater visibility into ownership and the resolution of rehypothecation concerns 3. decreased fraud • user information would be held only by entities that follow standards around data protection; this would reduce fraud (such as card‐not‐present transactions made using shipping and billing information stolen in large‐scale data breaches) • digital authentication methods would reduce fraud resulting from hacked or compromised user accounts decreased fraud world economic forum what benefits would accrue to fis from the implementation of digital identity? financial institutions 4. improved compliance • digital identity would give fis access to trusted up‐to‐date attribute information for users improving the accuracy of know‐your‐customer processes • digital information transfer and storage would allow fis to complete their compliance processes more quickly and easily allowing faster processing and reducing time spent on information remediation and correcting human error • compliance processes could be automated and executed on more regular cycles • digital identity would give fis better visibility into corporate ownership structures and the identity of corporate directors to improve corporate know‐your‐customer processes • digital identity would give fis better visibility into asset origination and ownership 5. revenue growth • fis could monetize identity‐as‐a‐service through business models such as subscription fees with rps or fee‐for‐ transaction services for high‐assurance identity transactions including: – authentication – digital signatures – the completion of identity transactions for rps such as providing attribute information (e.g. providing shipping information to merchants) or providing information about attributes (e.g. attesting to a merchant that a user is over a certain age based on date of birth) 6. better user experience and competitive positioning • by collaborating with governments public sector entities and other private sector entities fis would become part of a trusted ecosystem working on developing the digital economy • as trusted safeguards of user information fis would increase the strength of their relationships with users improved compliance revenue growth better user experience and competitive positioning world economic forum what benefits would accrue to fis from the implementation of digital identity? financial institutions: case studies aire is able to assist individuals who lack traditional credit information by using non‐traditional user attributes to build a new credit score. aire private company united kingdom aire a uk‐based start‐up offers an alternative to traditional credit‐scoring techniques. aire allows individuals to submit a wide range of materials that are used to evaluate the individual’s creditworthiness; for example a user could submit utility or netflix bills. know‐your‐customer utilities provide fis with access to trusted up‐to‐date attribute information for users improving the accuracy of individual and corporate know‐your‐customer processes. industry know‐your‐customer utilities private solutions global industry know‐your‐customer utilities such as thomson reuters’ orgid or dtcc’s clarient entity hub are intended to serve as reliable repositories of identity information on legal entities eliminating the need for entities to perform know‐your‐customer requirements on their counterparties in financial transactions and giving them access to reliable and current information. fis in the tupas system are the only entities to hold and transfer user information allowing them to monetize identity‐as‐a‐service through business models such as subscription or fee‐for‐transaction services with rps. tupas private sector solution finland in the tupas system rps must pay idps (in this case a consortium of banks) to access trusted and accurate user attributes. world economic forum future-state applications digital identity offers fis improved and new capabilities beyond the first‐level benefits of digital identity that fis would receive as a result of participating in an identity system we have explored some future‐looking use cases that illustrate additional capabilities that digital identity might offer to fis. potential future‐state applications 1. tailored risk profiles 2. international resettlement 3. attributes tied to payment tokens 4. digital tax filing 5. determining total risk exposure 6. identifying transaction counterparties 7. linking individual identity to corporate identity 8. tracking total asset rehypothecation world economic forum what additional capabilities can digital identity offer to fis? 1. tailored risk profiles 2. international resettlement current state: fis currently create risk profiles for individuals and legal entities using the limited information that is collected when customers are onboarded and predictive algorithms to provide relevant and tailored products and services to their customers. current state: today’s onboarding processes require every fi to onboard a customer from a zero‐knowledge state resulting in difficulty opening accounts for entities that are unable to prove their identities and disregard of financial history. how would digital identity help? fis could leverage trusted user attributes with a user’s consent to more effectively build risk profiles for their customers and therefore tailor credit‐ and risk‐based products. this enhanced user experience would ultimately lead to increased customer stickiness and offer growth opportunities for fis. how would digital identity help? users could transport their digital identity across jurisdictions and use it to easily gain access to financial and other services in their new place of residence; the attestations and attributes held by the user’s original fi(s) would serve as the basis for new fis to become idps. this would eliminate the need for the recipient fi to perform the costly and labour‐intensive know‐your‐customer process that would otherwise be required. in addition it would reduce the time and effort needed for fis to onboard users and allow them to incorporate trusted historical information. world economic forum what additional capabilities can digital identity offer to fis? 3. attributes tied to payment tokens 4. digital tax filing current state: when completing transactions customers are required to manually provide their attributes (e.g. confirmation of age shipping information) or proof of attributes to merchants at the point of sale. how would digital identity help? fis could automatically provide customer attributes to merchants streamlining and securing the transaction process for the merchant and customer. the digital transfer of attributes would eliminate the potential for human error in information transfer and dramatically reduce information remediation and transaction abandonment for the rp. note: this automatic transfer of attributes could be supported by an additional factor of authentication (e.g. mobile or behavioural authentication) to prevent fraud. current state: individuals and businesses currently file their taxes based on the aggregation of pieces of information from multiple sources (e.g. fis employers educational institutions etc.). how would digital identity help? in collaboration with governments taxes could be automatically completed and filings generated by customers’ chosen fis using their complete knowledge of customers’ financial holdings assets income and personal circumstances. with user consent all of this information would be available through a robust digital identity network. this would allow the typically complex and tedious tax filing process to be completed efficiently and accurately. world economic forum what additional capabilities can digital identity offer to fis? 5. determining total risk exposure 6. identifying transaction counterparties current state: legal entities are often unable to determine their total risk exposure to a given counterpart due to complicated ownership structures and difficulty aggregating a complete view of a legal entity. current state: it is currently challenging or impossible for entities to identify all entities that are participating in a given transaction; they may not have visibility into the end customer in a transaction that is being completed by a broker or other counterparty. how would digital identity help? transaction counterparties could have a consolidated view of the corporate structure of the entities with which they are transacting allowing them to determine their total risk exposure to that entity across transactions and lines of business. how would digital identity help? legal entities could request visibility into the consolidated identity of a third party and the ownership history of a given asset involved in a transaction. this would allow them to identify both the direct customer and the end customer in the transaction better informing the decision of whether to complete the transaction. world economic forum what additional capabilities can digital identity offer to fis? 7. linking individual identity to corporate identity 8. tracking total asset rehypothecation current state: individual and corporate identity information is currently not linked; it is challenging to identify individuals who are associated with corporate entities. how would digital identity help? the digital and standardized collection storage and transfer of attributes for both individuals and legal entities would ensure identity information is accurate and up‐to‐date. linkages between these systems would create reliable pictures of the identities of individuals affiliated with legal entities for know‐your‐customer and other purposes. current state: the transaction and ownership history of assets can become ambiguous as assets are rehypothecated; this exacerbates counterparty risk and asset valuation uncertainty while the lack of a historical tracking mechanism prevents the enforcement of limits on the extent of asset rehypothecation. how would digital identity help? consolidated standardized and digital identity information for assets would be available to all entities engaging in a transaction involving that asset giving transaction counterparties the ability to check asset information such as issuer and transaction history; this would enable the tracking of the asset ownership structure and composition and prevent over‐rehypothecation due to the lack of visibility into past transactions involving that asset. world economic forum 50% implementation of identity  systems implementation of a digital identity system should follow a bottom‐up approach we have outlined our perspective on the prime movers within digital identity solutions and how they should implement digital identity solutions. it is critical to observe that this is the first step in a bottom‐up approach that would result in systems being scaled outwards to incorporate greater numbers of users relying parties and identity providers as guidelines and functionality are tested and refined. the system is launched with a critical mass of parties to test and refine the system is scaled to increasing numbers of users relying parties and identity providers global identity will never exist as a monolith this document has laid out a principles‐based approach to building effective sustainable and bounded natural identity networks as the foundation for interconnecting individual identity networks. there will never be a single global solution for identity. identity serves different needs different user groups have different needs and requirements for identity. identity systems for individuals are designed to increase the ability of users to perform transactions in a safe and secure manner. identity systems for legal entities are intended to enable comprehensive aggregation at a macro level – whether to determine total exposure to a single legal entity or manage systematic risk and stability. identity systems for assets are designed to allow tracking and provide transparency around ownership and value. privacy is one of the key requirements of individual identity but is much less important in legal entity and asset identity and may even interfere with the larger purposes of these systems. individuals have self‐determination whereas legal entities and assets have custodians who act on their behalf. identity is cultural identity is hugely affected by cultural and geopolitical factors. for example while some populations are comfortable having a national id card this system has failed in other jurisdictions. certain authorities may not be a stable government to drive the creation and adoption of digital identity. this means that aside from having different configurations for purely practical reasons identity systems will differ dramatically to suit the cultural and geopolitical needs that they serve. there is no one‐size‐fits‐all for identity. world economic forum a global system for identity therefore initially requires the construction of discrete identity networks and then the creation of rails between them creating a global solution for identity is a two‐step process: the key to building a global system for digital identity is first building successful natural identity networks that address the unique needs and preferences of their user group and situation and then building connective tissue that creates interoperability between these systems. implementation: configuring natural identity networks interconnection: building the rails for global identity the configuration of natural identity networks will be guided by the decisions made against the primary and secondary dimensions of choice building the rails between natural identity systems will create global interconnection and interoperability world economic forum while the rails for global identity will begin to emerge as systems develop it is important that entities follow a guiding framework building identity as a two‐step process enables identity systems to be built by narrowing the required stakeholders to groups that have similar needs and concerns and therefore have relatively aligned incentives. it also ensures that these systems are tailored to the specific needs and wants of their user and stakeholder groups and will therefore gain the uptake that a top‐down one‐size‐fits‐all system would not attain. however these solutions should also be built following a common framework that will ensure interoperability by defining the features attributes and requirements of the identities that are exchanged in the system. this reinforces the need for individual identity systems to be built by entities such as financial institutions that have experience working together to define standards and then building individual systems within these standards. implementing discrete digital identity systems that suit the unique needs and cultural factors of users in their own jurisdictions and designing these systems around resilience interoperability and interconnection will allow a global blueprint for digital identity to emerge. world economic forum there are many standing questions and uncertainties that must be considered in the creation of new identity systems some thought starters to building identity solutions drivers of identity systems will need to consider many detailed tactical questions in the configuration and implementation of their own identity solutions. we have provided some example questions and uncertainties below. • which entities need to be involved in an identity system for your area and user group – governments regulators financial institutions consumer groups others? • what business model that will be sustainable in that situation – user pays relying party pays government pays? by transaction subscription subsidized through other services? • what governance structure is necessary for the system – who should be involved what should be the extent of their mandate how will governance be renewed and refreshed? • what is the minimum viable identity product required for that situation – what users should be involved what services need to be covered which entities should be involved what metrics are being tested? • which frameworks and standards can be adopted for the identity system? • which components of the identity stack must be proprietary and which ones can be outsourced or obtained through partnership? • what technology platform is required for the system? • what is the best method of communicating system functionality and benefits to users? world economic forum contact details for additional information please contact: world economic forum core project
