The services provided by Financial institutions in the US are changing rapidly. Changing business models and the technological revolution has fueled the growth of a new breed of financial products and services collectively known as “Fintech”.

With changing demographics, automation efforts and demand for new products and services, large financial institutions are realizing the power of technologies like data science, AI, cloud technologies and machine learning and are heavily investing to upgrade their technological platforms to cater to the upcoming revolution. Things are fast evolving and as we enter 2019, it is interesting to understand the hiring trends in the top financial institutions in the US. 


Our first objective is to understand the keywords that are typically used in Fintech. For this, We used the four reports provided by World Economic forum (WEF).

We extracted the keywords from these documents to build a dictionary of top keywords that could be used to describe the fintech space. We did this using PDFMinersix.

We extracted the top 100 keywords and built three lists using the following approaches: 
a. Wordcount
b. TF/IDF - Term Frequency/ Inverse Document Frequency
c. TextRank

Part two- Web Scraping of data from two US Bank Websites

We scraped the hiring data from top two US Banks- KeyCorp, Fifth Third Corp using BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium.


Part three- Analysis

We analyzed this data and drew insights on hiring patterns and trends.
